00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,560
Today I have the pleasure of interviewing Jacob  Kimmel, who is the president and co-founder of

00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,480
NewLimit, where they're trying to epigenetically  reprogram cells to their younger states.

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
Jacob, thanks so much for coming on the podcast. Thanks so much for having me. Looking

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
forward to the conversation. All right, first question.

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,720
What's the first principles argument for  why evolution just discards us so easily?

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,920
I know evolution cares about our kids. But if we have longer, healthier lifespans,

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,240
we can have more kids, right? We can care for them longer,

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,080
we can care for our grandkids. Is there some pleiotropic effect that an

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,000
anti-aging medicine would have which actually  selects against you staying young for longer?

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
I think there are a couple  different ways one can tackle this.

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,040
One is you have to think about what's  the selective pressure that would

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
make one live longer and encode for  higher health over longer durations.

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Do you have that selective pressure present? There's another which is, are there any

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,840
anti-selective pressures that are  actually pushing against that?

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
There's a third piece of this, which is  something like the constraints of your optimizer.

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,560
If we think about the genome as a set  of parameters and the optimizer is

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,000
natural selection, then you've got some  constraints on how that actually works.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,520
You can only do so many mutations at a time. You have to spend your steps that

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,120
update your genome in certain ways. Tackling those from a few different directions,

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,920
what would the positive possible selection be? As you highlighted, it might be something like,

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
"If I'm able to extend the lifespan of an  individual, they can have more children,

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,240
they can care for those children more effectively. That genome should propagate more

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,080
readily into the population." One of the challenges then—if you're

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:13,040
trying to think back in a thought experiment style  of evolutionary simulation here—would be: What

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,840
were the conditions under which a person would  actually live long enough for that phenotype to

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,320
be selected for, and how often would that occur? This brings us back to some very hypothetical

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,520
questions. Things like,

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,320
what was the baseline hazard rate during  the majority of human and primate evolution?

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,480
The hazard rate is simply, "What is the likelihood  you're going to die on any given day?" That

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,560
integrates everything. That's diseases from aging,  that's getting eaten by a tiger, that's falling

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,360
off a cliff, that's scraping your foot on a rock  and getting an infection and dying from that.

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
From the best evidence we have, the  baseline hazard rate was very, very high.

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,520
Even absent aging, you're unlikely to actually  reach those outer limits of possible health

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,600
where aging is one of the main limitations. The number of individuals in the population that

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,880
are going to make it later in that lifespan, where  using some of your evolutionary updates to try and

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,240
push your lifespan upward, is relatively limited. The amount of gradient signal flowing back to

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,840
the genome then is not as high  as one might intuitively think.

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,160
On that, often people who are trying  to forecast AI will discuss how hard

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,120
evolution tried to optimize for intelligence,  and what were the things which optimizing for

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,800
intelligence would have prevented evolution  from selecting for at the same time?

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,960
So even if intelligence were a relatively  easy thing to build in this universe,

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,000
it would have taken evolution so long  to get at human-level intelligence.

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,880
And, potentially, if intelligence were really  easy, then it might imply that we're going to get

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,080
superintelligence and Jupiter-level intelligence,  etc. The sky's the limit. One argument is birth

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,120
canal sizes, etc., or the fact that we had to  spend most of our resources on the immune system.

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,200
But what you just hinted at is an independent  argument that if you have this high hazard rate,

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,880
that would imply you can't be a kid for too long. Kids die all the time and you have to become an

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,200
adult so that you can have your kids. You’ve got to contribute

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,440
resources back to the group. You can't just be a freeloader.

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
You need to get calories, go out  in the jungle, get some berries.

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
If you're just hanging out learning stuff for  50 years, you're just going to die before you

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,840
get to have kids yourself. Obviously, humans have

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,080
bigger brains than other primates. We also have longer adolescences,

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
which help us make use potentially of  the extra capacity our brain gives us.

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
But if you made the adolescence too long, then  you would just die before you get to have kids.

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
If that's going to happen anyways, what's  the point of making the brain bigger?

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,880
AKA, maybe intelligence is easier  than we think, and there's a bunch

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
of contingent reasons evolution didn't churn  as hard on this variable as it could have.

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,920
I entirely agree with that particular thesis. In biology in general, when you're trying

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,000
to engineer a given property, be it being  healthier longer or be it making something

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,920
more intelligent… This is true even at the  micro-level of trying to engineer a system

00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,480
to manufacture a protein at high efficiency. You always have to start by asking yourself, "Did

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,280
evolution spend a lot of time optimizing this? If yes, my job is going to be insanely hard.

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,920
If not, potentially there  are some low-hanging fruit."

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,600
This is a good argument for why, potentially,  intelligence wasn't strongly selected for.

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
The lifespan argument plays back  into intelligence to a degree.

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,720
You start to ask, "If I have intelligence that's  able to compound over time and for instance, in

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
some hypothetical universe, my fluid intelligence  lasts much longer into my lifespan…" If the number

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
of people who are reaching something like  65 is very small in a population, you're not

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
necessarily going to select for alleles that lead  to fluid intelligence preservation late into life.

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
This is part of my own pet hypothesis around  some of the interesting phenomenology in when

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,920
discoveries are made throughout lifespans. There  are some famous results. For instance—and I'm

00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,680
going to get the exact age a little bit wrong—but  in mathematics, most great discoveries happen

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
roughly before 30. Why should that be true?  That doesn't make sense. You can put down

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,560
a bunch of societal reasons for it. Maybe you become staid in your ways.

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,760
Your teachers have caused you to  restrict your thinking by that point.

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,120
But really, that's true across centuries? Is that true across many different

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,760
unique cultures around the world? That's true in both cultures from

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,720
the East and cultures from the West? That seems  unlikely to me. A much simpler explanation is that

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,600
for whatever reason, our fluid intelligence is  roughly maximized at the time where the population

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,080
size during human evolution was maximal. If you had to pick an age at which fluid

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,360
intelligence was selected most strongly  for, it's probably around 25 or 30.

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
That's probably about the age of the adults  in the large populations that were being

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
selected for during most of evolution. There's a lot of reason here to think

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,240
that there's interplay between many features  of modern humans and how long we were living,

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,640
and how that dictates some of the features that  occur that rise and fall throughout our lives.

00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,360
In one way, this is a very interesting RL problem. It's a long-horizon RL problem, a 20-year horizon

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,760
length, and then there's a scalar value of how  many kids you have, I guess that survive, etc.

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,760
If you've heard from your friends about  how hard RL is on these models for just

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,320
very intermediate goals that last an hour  or a couple of hours, it's surprising that

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,720
any signal propagates across a 20-year horizon. On the point about fluid intelligence peaking,

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,240
it’s not only the case that in many  fields achievement peaks before 30.

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,920
In many cases, if you look at the greatest  scientists ever, they had many of their greatest

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,186
achievements in a single year. Yeah, the annus mirabilis.

00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:26,160
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Newton, what is it? Optics,  gravity, calculus at 21.

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
Do you know the Alexander von Humboldt story? No.

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,640
Alexander von Humboldt is one  of the most famous scientists in

00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,640
history who is kind of forgotten now. He had this one expedition to South

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,720
America where he climbed Mount Chimborazo at  a time when very few Europeans had done that.

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,640
He was able to observe various  ecological layers that were

00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,600
repeated across latitudes and across altitudes. It caused him to formulate an understanding of

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,080
how selection was operating on plants  at different layers in the ecosystem.

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,880
That one expedition was the  basis of his entire career.

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,160
When you see something named Humboldt, just  to give you a sense of how famous this guy is,

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
it's usually Alexander von Humboldt. It's not like this is some massive,

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,400
prosperous German family name that just happens  to be really common. It's this one guy. So really

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,000
it was like this singular year in which he  conceived a lot of our modern understanding

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,600
of botany and selective pressure. Interesting. So that's one out of

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,920
three components of the evolutionary story. The next piece of the evolutionary story is,

00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,680
"Is there anything selecting against longevity?" Let's just pretend everything I said was wrong.

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,280
Can I still make an argument that maybe evolution  hasn't maximally optimized for our longevity?

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,240
One argument that comes up, and I'll  caveat and say I don't know how strong

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,560
some of the mathematical models  that people put together here are.

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,600
You can find people using the same  idea to argue for and against.

00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,840
But there's this notion of  what's called kin selection.

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,560
If you take a selfish gene view of the world—that  really this is the genome optimizing for the

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,840
genome's propagation, it's not trying to optimize  for any one individual—then actually optimizing

00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,240
for longevity is a pretty tricky problem  because you have this nasty regularization term.

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,880
If you're able to make a member of the  population live longer, but you don't also

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,360
counteract the decrease in their fitness over  time—meaning you maybe extend maximum lifespan

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,920
but you haven't totally eliminated aging—then  the number of net calories contributed to the

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,880
genome as a function of that person's marginal  year and their own calorie consumption is less

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
than if you were to allow that individual  to die and actually have two 20 year olds,

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
for instance, that follow behind them. So there is a notion by which a population being

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,640
laden demographically with many aged individuals,  even if they did have fecundity persisting out

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,880
some period later in life, is actually net  negative for the genome's proliferation

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,440
and that really a genome should optimize for  turnover and population size at max fitness.

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,160
I love this idea of aging as a length regularizer. People might be familiar with the idea that when

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
companies are training models, they'll have a  regularizer for, "You can do chain of thought,

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,800
but don't make the chain of thought too long." You're saying how many calories you consume over

00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,560
the course of your life, is one such regularizer?  That's interesting. The third point was...

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
The third piece is basically  optimization constraints.

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,880
So this is where another ML analogy is helpful. Well, actually a two-layer neural network is

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,440
technically a universal approximator, but we can  never actually fit them in such a way. Why does

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
that occur? People will wave their hands, but it  basically comes down to the fact that we don't

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,520
really know how to optimize them, even  if you can prove out in a formal sense

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,520
that they are universal approximators. I think we have similar optimization

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,240
challenges with our genome as the parameters  and evolution as the optimization algorithm.

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,840
One of those is that your mutation rate  basically bounds the step size you can take.

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,040
So if you imagine that at each  generation, you get some number of inputs,

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,680
you can select for some number of alleles. The max number of variations in the genome

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,920
is set by your mutation rate. If you dial your mutation rate

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,600
up too high, you probably get a bunch  of cancers, so you're selected against.

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,840
If you have it too low, you  can't really adapt to anything.

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,640
You end up with this happy medium,  but that limits your total step size.

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
Then the number of variants  you can screen in parallel is

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
basically limited by your population size. So for most of evolution, there are lots

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,080
of forces constraining population size as well. One of the dominant sources of selection on the

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,200
genome is really prevention of infectious disease. It seems like when you study the history of early

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
modern man, infectious disease is actually what  shaped a lot of our population demographics.

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,320
There's a lot of pressure pushing for those  step sizes, those updates to the genome,

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,560
really to be optimizing for protection against  infectious disease rather than other things.

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Even if you imagine that maybe the arguments  on the first and the second of these possible

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,600
positive selection being absent for longevity  and potentially some negative selection existing,

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,280
you could construct a reasonable argument  for why humans don't live forever and why

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,040
the genome hasn't optimized for that, simply  based on these optimization constraints.

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,920
You have to imagine not only that the  positive selection is there and the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
negative selection is absent, but that when you  think about the weighted loss term of all the

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,480
things the genome is optimizing for, that the  weight on longevity is high enough to matter.

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,920
Even if you imagine it's there, if you simply  imagine that the lambdas are dialed toward

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,320
infectious disease resilience more effectively,  then you can construct an argument for yourself.

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
And so I think really when you start  to ask "why don't we live forever,

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
why didn't evolution solve this?" you actually  have to think about an incredibly contingent

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,160
scenario where both the positive selection is  there, the negative selection is absent, and you

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,840
have a lot of our evolutionary pressure going  toward longevity to solve this incredibly hard

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,120
problem in order to construct the counterfactual  in which longevity is selected for and does arise

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,840
in modern man and in which we are optimal. So I think that puts human aging and longevity

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,400
and health really in this category of problems  in which evolution has not optimized for it.

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,000
Ergo, it should be, relatively speaking,  relative to a problem evolution had worked on,

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,560
easy to try and intervene and provide health. In many ways, the existence of modern medicines,

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,200
which are incredibly simplistic—we are targeting  a single gene in the genome and turning it off

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,840
everywhere at the same time—the fact that these  provide massive benefit to individuals is another

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,240
sort of positive emission or piece of evidence. Antibiotics are an even more clear case

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,760
of that because here's something that  evolution actually cares a lot about.

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
It feels like antibiotics should be… Why didn't humans evolve their own antibiotics?

00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
Yeah. It's an excellent question that I haven't

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,680
heard posed before. Where do antibiotics come  from? To your point, we could synthesize them.

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,040
They're just metabolites, largely  of other bacteria or other fungi.

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,480
You think about the story of penicillin. What  happens? Alexander Fleming finds some fungi

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,240
growing on a dish. The fungi secrete

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,000
this penicillin antibiotic compound. So there's no bacteria growing near the fungi.

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
He says he has this light bulb moment  of, "Oh my gosh, they're probably

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,080
making something that kills bacteria." There's no prima facie reason that you

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,080
couldn't imagine encoding an antibiotic  cassette into a mammalian genome.

00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,000
Part of the challenge that you run into is  that you're always in evolutionary competition.

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,960
There's this notion of what's  called the Red Queen hypothesis.

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,240
It's an allusion to the story in Lewis  Carroll's Through the Looking Glass,

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,680
where the Red Queen is running  really fast just to stay in place.

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,800
When you look at pathogen-host interactions or  competition between bacteria and fungi that are

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,560
all trying to compete for the same niche, what  you find is they're evolving very rapidly in

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
competition with one another. It's an arms  race. Every time a bacteria evolves a new

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,640
evasion mechanism, the fungus that occupies  the niche will evolve some new antibiotic.

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,400
Part of why there is this competitiveness  between the two is they both have very

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,280
large population sizes in terms of number of  genomes per unit resource they're consuming.

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,480
There are trillions of bacteria in a  drop of water that you might pick up.

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,600
There's trillions of copies of the genome. Massive  analog parallel computation. And at the same time,

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,080
they can tolerate really high mutation rates  because they're prokaryotic. They don't have

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,400
multiple cells. If one cell manages to mutate too  much and it isn't viable, or it grows too fast,

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
it doesn't really compromise the  population and the whole genome.

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,400
Whereas for metazoans like you and I, if  even one of our cells has too many mutations,

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,440
it might turn into a cancer and  eventually kill off the organism.

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,720
What I'm getting at, and this is a long-winded  way of getting there, is that bacteria and other

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,720
types of microorganisms are very well adapted to  building these complex metabolic cascades that are

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,160
necessary to make something like antibiotics. It's necessary to maintain that same mutation

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,520
rate and population size in order  to maintain the competition.

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,760
Even if our human genome stumbled into making  an antibiotic, most pathogens probably would

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,880
have mutated around it pretty quickly. That should imply that through evolutionary

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,800
history there are millions of "naive  antibiotics" which could have acted as

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,760
antibiotics, but now, basically, all  the bacteria have evolved around it.

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,440
Do we see evidence of these historical  antibiotics that some fungi came up

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,360
with and the bacteria revolved around and  there's evidence for remnants in their DNA?

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm going a bit beyond my own knowledge  here, but my strong hypothesis would be yes.

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
I can't point to direct evidence today. There are some examples of this.

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,840
For instance, bacteria that fight  off viruses that infect them,

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,400
bacteriophages, have things like CRISPR systems. You can actually go and look at the spacers,

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,080
the individual guide sequences that tell  the CRISPR system, "Which genome do you

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,080
go? Where do you cut?" And you find some  of these guides that are very ancient.

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,720
It seems like this bacterial genome  might not have encountered that

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
particular pathogen for quite a while. So you can actually get an evolutionary

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,480
history of what the warfare was like, what the  various conflicts were throughout this genomic

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,480
history just by looking at those sequences. In mammals where I do know a bit better,

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,560
we do have examples of this where there  is this co-evolution of pathogen and host.

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,080
Imagine you have some antipathogen gene A fighting  off some virus X. Well you then actually update.

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,560
Now you have virus X’ and antipathogen gene A’. Now virus X’ goes away, but actually virus X

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
still exists and we've lost our ability to fight  it. Those examples really do happen. There's a

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,640
prominent one in the human genome. We have a gene called TRIM5alpha.

00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,560
It actually binds an endogenous retrovirus that is  no longer present, but was at one point actually

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,920
resurrected by a bunch of researchers. It was demonstrated that this is the case.

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,800
We have this endogenous gene which basically fits  around the capsid of the virus like a baseball

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,160
in a glove and prevents it from infecting. It turns out if you look at the evolutionary

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
history of that gene and you trace it  back through monkeys, you can actually

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,680
find that a previous iteration inhibited  SIV, which is the cousin of HIV in humans.

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,640
Old World monkeys actually can't get SIV, whereas  New World monkeys can and humans can, obviously.

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,760
So it seems like what happened—and you  can actually make a few mutations in

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,560
TRIM5alpha and find that this is true—is  that TRIM5alpha once protected against an

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,480
HIV-like pathogen in the primate genomes. And then there was this challenge from

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,040
this massive endogenous retrovirus. It was so bad that the genome lost the

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,520
ability to fight off these HIV-like viruses in  order to restrict this endogenous retrovirus.

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,240
You can see it because that  retrovirus integrates into our genome.

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,200
There are latent copies, like the half bodies  of this virus all throughout our DNA code.

00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,520
Then this particular retrovirus went extinct. Reasons unknown, no one knows why.

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,320
But we didn't re-update that piece of our  host defense machinery to fight off HIV again.

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,360
So we're in a situation where you can  go in and take human cells and make just

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
a couple edits in that TRIM5alpha gene. It's currently protecting against a virus

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,520
which no longer exists. You can edit it back to

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,400
actually restrict HIV dramatically. So there are plenty of examples.

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,360
You could imagine the same thing for  antibiotics where like, "hey, this

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,080
particular defense mechanism went away because  the pathogen evolved its own defense to it."

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,720
Well, the pathogen might have  lost that defense long ago.

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,280
If you could extract that historical  antibiotic, that historical antifungal,

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
potentially it actually has efficacy. Isn't the mutation rate per base pair per

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
generation like one in a billion or something? It's quite low.

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,760
You're saying that in our genomes we can find  some extended sequence which encodes how to bind

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,120
specifically to the kind of virus that SIV is. The amount of evolutionary signal you would need

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,760
in order to have a multiple base pair sequence…  So each nucleotide consecutively would have to

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,760
mutate in order to finally get the sequence that  binds to SIV. That seems almost implausible.

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,840
I guess evolution works, so we can come up  with new genes, but how would that even work?

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,720
A great explanation for understanding a lot of  evolution and how you're able to actually adapt

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,000
to new environments, new pathogens, is that gene  duplication is possible. This explains a whole

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
lot. If you look at most genes in the genome,  they actually arise at least at some point in

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,200
evolution from a duplication event. That means you've got gene A,

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,920
it's performing some job, and then some  new environmental concern comes along.

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,120
Maybe it's a lack of a particular source of  nutrient, maybe it's a pathogen challenging you.

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,200
Maybe gene A, if it were to dedicate all  of its energies, so to speak and you were

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,760
to mutate it to solve this new problem, could  be adapted with a minimal number of mutations.

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,440
But then you lose its original function. So we have this nice feature of the genome

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,320
which is that it can just copy and paste. So occasionally what will happen in evolution

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,120
is you get a copy paste event. Now I've got two copies of gene

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
A and I can preserve my original  function in the original copy.

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
Then this new copy can actually mutate  pretty freely because it doesn't have a

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,960
strong selective pressure on it. So most mutations might be null.

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
I've got two copies of the gene, I can  have lots of mutations in it accumulate.

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,680
Nothing bad really happens because  I've got my backup copy, my original.

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,400
So you can end up with drift. You're saying that even though

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,720
the per base pair mutation rate might be one in  a billion, if you've got 100 copies of a gene,

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:58,480
then the mutation rate on a gene, or on a  low Hamming distance sequence to the one

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,760
you're aiming for, might actually be quite high,  and you can actually get the target sequence.

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,160
It's not that the base rate goes up. It's not like DNA polymerase is more

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,720
erroneous or that you're just doubling it. That is true, but I don't think

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,200
it's the main mechanism. One of the main mechanisms

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,800
that just makes it difficult for evolution to  solve a problem is if a mutation breaks a gene.

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,880
Somewhere along the path of edits, imagine  there are three edits that take a host defense

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,560
gene from restricting SIV to restricting  this new nasty PT endogenous retrovirus.

00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,680
Well, if one edit just breaks the gene, two edits  just breaks the gene, three edits fixes it, it's

00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,640
really hard for evolution to find a path whereby  you're actually able to make those first two edits

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,320
because they're net negative for fitness. So you need some really weird

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,080
contingent circumstances. Through duplication, you can create a scenario

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
where those first two edits are totally tolerated. They have no effect on fitness.

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,560
You've got your backup copy, it's doing its job. Even though the mutation rate is low, some of

00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,440
these edits actually aren't that large. I'm going to forget the number of edits,

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,800
for instance in TRIM5alpha, for this  particular phenomenon, but it's in the tens.

00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,640
It's not that you need massive  kilobase scale rearrangements.

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,200
It's actually a fairly small number of edits. Basically you can just align the sequence of

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,040
this gene in New World versus Old World  monkeys and then for humans and you find

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,800
there's a very high degree of conservation. Conceptually, is there some phylogenetic

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,120
tree of gene families where you've got the  transposons and you've got the gene itself,

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,320
but then you've got the descendant  genes which are low Hamming distance?

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,480
Is there some conceptual way  in which they're categorized?

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
You can arrange genes in the human  genome by homology to one another.

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,280
What you find is even in our current genome,  even without having the full historical record,

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,200
there are many, many genes which are  likely resulting from duplication events.

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
One trivial way that you can check this for  yourself is just go look at the names of genes.

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,960
Very often you'll see something  where it's like gene one, gene two,

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,040
gene three or type one, type two, type three. If you then go look at the sequences,

00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,240
sometimes those names arise from the fact that  they were discovered in a common pathway and they

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,560
have nothing to do with each other. A lot of the time it's because the

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,640
sequences are actually quite darn similar. Really what probably happened is they evolved

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,680
through a duplication event and then maybe  did some swapping with some other genes.

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,040
And you ended up with these  quite similar, quite homologous

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,800
genes that now have specialized functions. So when evolution has a new problem to solve,

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,160
it doesn't have to start from scratch. It starts from what was the last copy

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,920
of the parameters for encoding a gene  that is getting close to solving this.

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Okay, let's do a copy paste on that and then  iterate and fine-tune on those parameters as

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,000
opposed to having to start with "ab initio,  some random stretch of sequence somewhere

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
in the genome has to become a gene." This is fascinating. Back to aging.

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640
You’ll have to cancel your evening plans. I've got so many questions for you.

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:47,120
Keep going man. So the second reason you gave was that there's

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:57,680
selective pressure against people who get old but  still keep living, but they're slightly less fit.

00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,600
They’re suboptimal from a calorie input  perspective, the number of calories they can

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
gather for the population is lower. That's how people love

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,920
thinking about their grandpas. Suboptimal calorie provider right there.

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,360
A concern you might have about the effects  of longevity treatments on your own body

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,840
is that you will fix some part of the  aging process, but not the whole thing.

00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,920
It seems like you're saying that you actually  think this is the default way in which an

00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:30,880
anti-aging procedure would work, because that's  the reason evolution didn't optimize for it.

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
We're only fixing half of the aging  process and not the whole thing.

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,000
Whereas sometimes I hear longevity proponents  be like, "No, we'll get the whole thing.

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,600
There's going to be a source that  explains all of aging and we'll get it."

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,680
Whereas, your evolutionary argument  for why evolution didn't optimize

00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:55,200
against aging relies on the fact that aging  actually is not monocausal and evolution

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,160
didn't bother to just fix one cause of aging. That's correct. I don't think that there is a

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,200
single monocausal explanation for aging. I think there are layers of molecular

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,160
regulation that explain a lot. For instance, I have dedicated

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,200
my career now to working on epigenetics  and trying to change which genes cells

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
use because I think that explains a lot of it. But it's not that there is some upstream "bad

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,600
gene X" and all we have to do is turn  that off and suddenly aging is solved.

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,000
The most likely outcome is that when we eventually  develop medicines that prolong health in each of

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,040
us, it's not going to fix everything all at once. There's not going to be a singular magic pill.

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,640
Rather you're going to have medicines that  add multiple healthy years to your life,

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
years you can't otherwise get back. But it's not going to fix

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,040
everything at the same time. You are still going to experience, for the

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,080
first medicine, some amount of decline over time. This gives you an example, if you think about

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,240
evolution as a medicine maker in this sort  of anthropomorphic context, of why it might

00:24:48,240 --> 00:26:12,960
not have been selected for immediately. So evolution didn't select for aging. What are you

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,440
doing? What's your approach at NewLimit that you  think is likely to find the true cause of aging?

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,200
We're working on something called epigenetic  reprogramming, which very broadly is using

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,920
genes called transcription factors. I like to think about these as the

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,040
orchestra conductors of the genome. They don't perform many functions

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,200
directly themselves, but they bind specific  pieces of DNA and then they tell which

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
genes to turn on, which genes to turn off. They eventually put chemical marks on top

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,680
of DNA, on some proteins that DNA surrounds. This is one of the answers, this particular

00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,360
layer of regulation called the epigenome. It's the answer to this fundamental biological

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
question of how do all my cells have the same  genome but ultimately do very different things?

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,960
Your eyeball and your kidney have the same code,  and yet they're performing different functions.

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,920
That may sound a little bit simplistic, but  ultimately, it's kind of a profound realization.

00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,280
That epigenetic code is really what's  important for cells to define their functions.

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,240
That's what's telling them which  genes to evoke from your genome.

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,080
What has now become relatively apparent is that  the epigenome can degrade with age. It changes.

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,320
The particular marks that tell your cells  which genes to use can shift as you get older.

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,200
This means that cells aren't able to  use the right genetic programs at the

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,440
right times to respond to their environment. You're then more susceptible to disease, you have

00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,440
less resilience to many insults  that you might experience.

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,080
Our hope is that by remodeling the epigenome back  towards the state it was in when you were young

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
right after development, that you'll be able  to actually address myriad different diseases

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,400
whose one of strong contributing factors is  that cells are less functional than when you

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,320
were at an earlier point in your life. We're going after this by trying to find

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,040
combinations of these transcription factors that  are able to actually remodel the epigenome so

00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,280
that they can bind to just the right places in the  DNA and then shift the chemical marks back toward

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,600
that state when you are a young individual. If you're just making these broad changes to

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,520
a cell state through these transcription factors  which have many effects, are there other aspects

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,960
of a cell state that are likely to get modified at  the same time in a way that would be deleterious.

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
Or would it be a straightforward  effect on cell state?

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,440
How I wish it were straightforward. No, it's very  likely. Each of these transcription factors binds

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
hundreds to thousands of places in the genome. One way of thinking about it is if you imagine the

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,080
genome as the base components of cell function,  then these transcription factors are kind of like

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,640
the basis set in linear algebra. It's different combinations and

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,440
different weights of each of the genes. Most of them are targeting pretty broad programs.

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,720
There are no guarantees that aging actually  involves moving perfectly along any of

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,400
the vectors in this particular basis set. And so it's probably going to be a little

00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,200
tricky to figure out a combination  that actually takes you backward.

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,880
There's, again, no guarantees from  evolution that it's just a simple reset.

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,960
It's actually a critical part of the process  that we run through as we try to discover these

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
medicinal combinations of transcription factors  we can turn on, ensuring that they not only are

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,600
making an aged cell revert to a younger state... We measure that a couple different ways.

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
One is simply measuring which  genes those cells are using.

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,360
They use different genes as they get older. You can measure that just by sequencing all

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,480
of the mRNAs, which are really  the expressed form of the genes

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,160
being utilized in the genome at a given time. You see that aged cells use different genes.

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,240
Can I revert them back to a younger state? Colloquially, we call this a "looks like" assay.

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,360
Can I make an old cell look like a  young one based on the genes it's using?

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,840
More importantly, we go down and  drill to the functional level.

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,520
We measure, "Can I actually make an aged cell  perform its functions, its object roles within

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,480
the body, the same way a young cell would?" These are the really critical things

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,720
you care about for treating diseases. Can I make a hepatocyte, a liver cell in Greek,

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,880
function better in your liver so it's able to  process metabolites like the foods you eat,

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,160
how it's able to process toxins  like alcohol and caffeine?

00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,720
Can I make a T cell respond to pathogens and other  antigens that are presented within your body?

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,240
These are the ways in which we measure age. We need to ensure that not only does the

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,160
combination of TFs that we find actually  have positive effects along those axes.

00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,320
But we then want to also measure any  potential detrimental effects that emerge.

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,080
There are canonical examples where you  can seemingly reverse the age of a cell,

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,280
for instance, at the level of a  transcriptome, but simultaneously, you

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,160
might be changing that cell's type or identity. Shinya Yamanaka was a scientist who won the Nobel

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,240
in 2012 for some work he did in about 2007,  where he discovered that you could just take

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,960
four transcription factors and actually, just by  turning on these four genes, turn an adult cell

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,920
all the way back into a young embryonic stem cell. It's a pretty amazing existence proof that shows

00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,880
that you can reprogram a cell's type and a cell's  age simultaneously, just by turning on four genes.

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
Out of the 20,000 genes in the genome, the  tens of millions of biomolecular interactions,

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,520
just four genes is enough. That's a shocking  fact. We actually have known for many years

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,520
now that you can reprogram the age of a cell. The challenge is that simultaneously, you're doing

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
a bunch of other stuff, as you alluded to. You're changing its type,

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,040
and that might be pathological. If you did that in the body, it would probably

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,640
cause a type of tumor called a teratoma. So we measure not only at the level

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,120
of the genes a cell is using. Do you still look like the right type

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,680
of cell? Are you still hepatocyte? Are you still a  T cell? If not, that's probably pathological. You

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,000
can also use that same information to check for  a number of other pathologies that might develop.

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
Did I make this T cell hyperinflammatory  in a way that would be bad?

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,320
Did I make this liver cell potentially  neoplastic, proliferate too much even

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,760
when the organism's healthy and undamaged? You can check for each of those at the level

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,240
of gene expression programs  and likewise, functionally.

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,160
Before you put these molecules in a human, you  actually just functionally check in an animal.

00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,720
You make an itemized list of the  possible risks you might run into.

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,680
Here are the ways it might be toxic,  here are the ways it might cause cancer.

00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,960
Are we able to measure deterministically and  empirically that that doesn't actually occur?

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,480
This is a dumb question, but it will help me  understand why an AI model is necessary to do

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,920
any of this work. You mentioned the Yamanaka  factors. From my understanding, the way he

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:52,480
identified these four transcription factors was  that he found the 24 transcription factors that

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,960
have high expression in embryonic cells, and then  he just turned them all on in a somatic cell.

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,240
Basically, he systematically removed from  this set until he found the minimal set that

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,560
still induces a cell to become a stem cell. That doesn't require any fancy AI models.

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,880
Why can't we do the same things for the  transcription factors that are expressed more in

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,040
younger cells as opposed to older cells, and then  keep eliminating from them until we find the ones

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,600
that are necessary to just make a cell young? I wish it were so easy. You're entirely right.

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,520
Shinya Yamanaka was able to do  this with a relatively small team,

00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,040
with relatively few resources, and achieve  this remarkable feat. It's entirely worth

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,000
asking. Why can't a similar procedure work for  arbitrary problems in reprogramming cell state?

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Whether it be trying to make an aged cell act like  a young one, a disease cell act like a healthy

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,840
one, why can't you just take 24 transcription  factors and randomly sort through them?

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,120
There were two features of Shinya's  problem that I think make it amenable

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,960
to that sort of interrogation that aren't  present for many other types of problems.

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,400
This is why he's such a remarkable scientist. Most of science is problem selection.

00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,520
You don't actually get better at pipetting  or running experiments after a certain age,

00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,760
but you do get better at picking what to do.  He's amazing at this. The first feature is that

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,840
measuring your success criterion is trivial  in the particular case he was investigating.

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,320
He's starting with somatic cells that, in this  case, were a type of fibroblast, which literally

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
is defined as cells that stick to glass and  grow in a dish when you grind up a tissue.

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,240
It sounds fancy, but it's a very simplistic thing. He's starting with fibroblasts, you can look

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,400
at them under a microscope, and you can see  they’re fibroblasts just based on how they look.

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,440
Then the cells he's reprogramming  toward are embryonic stem cells.

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,280
These are tiny cells, they're mostly nucleus. They  grow really fast. They look different, they detach

00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,720
from a dish, they grow up into a 3D structure. They express some genes that will just never be

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,200
turned on in a fibroblast by definition. How he ran the experiment was he just

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,160
set up a simple reporter system. He took a gene that should never be

00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,520
on in a fibroblast, should only be on in  the embryo, and he put a little reporter

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,200
behind it so that these cells would actually  turn blue when you dumped a chemical on them.

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,240
Then he ran this experiment in many, many  dishes with millions upon millions of cells.

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,200
The second really key feature of the  problem is this notion that those

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,760
cells he's converting into amplify. They divide and grow really quickly.

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,040
In order for you to find a successful  combination, you don't actually

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,960
need it to be efficient almost at all. The original efficiency Yamanaka published,

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,440
the number of cells in the dish that convert from  somatic to an induced pluripotent state, back into

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,080
a stem cell, is something like a basis point  or a tenth of a basis point, so 0.01%, 0.001%.

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,000
If these cells were not growing and  they were not proliferating like mad,

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,080
you probably would never be able to detect that  you had actually found anything successful.

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,400
It's only because success is easy to  measure once you have it and—even being

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,760
successful in very rare cases, one in a  million—amplifies and you can detect it,

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,880
that this was amenable to his particular approach. In practice, what he would do is dump these

00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,200
factors or this group of 24 minus some  number, eventually whittling it down to four.

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,120
He would dump these onto a group of cells  and over the course of about 30 days,

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,760
just a few cells in that dish, like a countable  number on your fingers, would actually reprogram.

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,800
But they would proliferate like mad. They form  these big colonies. It's a single cell that

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
just proliferates and forms a bunch of copies of  itself. They form these colonies. You can see with

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,520
your eyeballs by holding the dish up to the light  and looking for opaque little dots on the bottom.

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,160
You don't need any fancy instruments. Then you could stain them with this

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,600
particular stain and they would turn blue  based on the genetic reporter he had.

00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,800
We look at those key features of the problem and  we pick any other problem we're interested in.

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm interested in aging, so that's the  one I'm going to pick for explanation.

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,200
How difficult is it to measure the  likelihood of success or whether

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,040
you've achieved success for cell age? It turns out age is much more complicated

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,520
in terms of discriminating function than  actually just comparing two types of cells.

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,080
An old liver cell and a young liver cell,  prima facie, actually look pretty darn similar.

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,360
It's actually quite nuanced the  ways in which they're distinct.

00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,160
There isn't a simple, trivial system where you  just label your one favorite gene or you can just…

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,640
Give the young cells cancer. They'll grow. Just make the old ones cancer,

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,120
and then they'll grow. Dwarkesh, you've solved it for me.

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,200
There's no trivial way that you can  tell whether or not you've succeeded.

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,840
You actually need a pretty  complex molecular measurement.

00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,120
For us, a real key enabling technology—I  don't think our approach would really

00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,000
have been possible until it emerged—was  something called single-cell genomics.

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,840
You now take a cell, rip it open,  sequence all the mRNAs it's using.

00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,000
At the level of individual cells, you can actually  measure every gene that they're using at a given

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,600
time and get this really complete picture  of a cell's state, everything it's doing,

00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,760
lots of mutual information to other features. From that profile, you can train something

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,080
like a model that discriminates young and  aged cells with really high performance.

00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,520
It turns out there's no one gene that  actually has that same characteristic.

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,400
Unlike in Yamanaka's case, where a single gene  on or off is an amazing binary classifier,

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,920
you don't have that same feature of  easy detection of success in aging.

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,200
The second feature is, as you highlighted,  we can't just turn these into cancer cells.

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,160
Success doesn't amplify. In some ways, the bar  for a medicine is higher than what Yamanaka

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,520
achieved in his laboratory discovery. You can't just have 0.001% success and

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,760
then wait for the cells to grow a whole bunch in  order to treat a patient's disease or make their

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,800
liver younger, make their immune system  younger, make their endothelium younger.

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,240
You need to actually have it be fairly  efficient across many cells at a time.

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,520
Because of this, we don't have the same luxury  Yamanaka did of taking a relatively small

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,040
number of factors and finding a success case  within there that was pretty low efficiency.

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,360
We actually need to search a much broader  portion of TF space in order to be successful.

00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,440
And when you start playing that game,  and you think "How many TFs are there?"

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,320
Somewhere between 1000 and 2000, it  depends on exactly where you draw the line.

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,520
Developmental biologists love to argue about  this over beer, but let's call it 2000 for now.

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,880
You want to choose some combination. Let's say you guess somewhere between one

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,520
and six factors might be required. The number of possible

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,760
combinations is about 10^16. If you do any math on the back of a napkin,

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,600
in order to just screen through all of those, you  would need to do many orders of magnitude more

00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:52,400
single-cell sequencing than the entire world has  done to date cumulatively across all experiments.

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,040
It's just not tractable to do exhaustively. That's where actually having models that

00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,600
can predict the effect of  these interventions comes in.

00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,520
If I can do a sparse sampling, I can test  a large number of these combinations.

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,120
I can start to learn the relationship  of what a given transcription factor

00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,840
is going to do to an aged cell. Is it going to make it look younger?

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,880
Is it going to preserve the same type? I can learn that across combinations.

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,040
I can start to learn their interaction terms. Now I can use those models to actually predict

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,600
in silico for all the combinations I haven't seen,  which are most likely to give me the state I want.

00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,280
You can actually treat that as a generative  problem and start sampling and asking which

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,920
of these combinations is most likely to take my  cell to some target destination in state space.

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,560
In our case, I want to take an old  cell to a young state, but you could

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,640
imagine some arbitrary mappings as well. As you get to these more complex problems,

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,880
you don't have the same features that Shinya  benefited from, which were the ability to

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,000
measure success really easily—you can see it  with your bare eyes, you don't even need a

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,840
microscope—and two, amplification, as you  get into these more challenging problems.

00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,160
You're going to need to be able to search a larger  fraction of the space to hit that higher bar.

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,760
So we can think of these transcription  factors as these basis directions,

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,240
and you can get a little bit of this thing, a  little bit of that thing and some combination.

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,720
And evolution has designed these  transcription factors to…Is that your claim?

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,240
They have relatively modular, self-contained  effects that work in predictable ways with

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:18,000
other transcription factors and so we  can use that same handle to our own ends?

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,840
That would be very much my contention. One piece of evidence for this is

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,800
that's the way development works. It's a crazy thing to think about,

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,480
but you and I were both just a single cell. Then we were a bag of undifferentiated cells

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,280
that were all exactly alike. Somehow we became humans with

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,000
hundreds of different cell types  all doing very different things.

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,120
When you look at how development  specifies those unique fates of cells,

00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,800
it is through groups of these transcription  factors that each identify a unique type.

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,120
In many cases, the groups of transcription  factors, the sets that specify very different

00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,440
fates, are actually pretty similar to one another. Evolution has optimized to just swap one TF in

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,600
or swap one TF out of a combination  and get pretty different effects.

00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,600
You have this sort of local change in sequence  or gene set space leading to a pretty large

00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,560
global change in output. Likewise, many of these

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,240
TFs are duplicated in the genome. Because mutations are going to be

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,800
random and they're inherently small changes  at the level of sequence at a given time,

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,520
evolution needs a substrate where, in order to  function effectively, these small changes can

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,200
give you relatively large changes in phenotype. Otherwise it would just take a very long time

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,800
across evolutionary history for enough  mutations to accumulate in some duplicated

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,640
copy of the gene for you to evolve a  new TF that does something interesting.

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,560
I think we're actually in most cases in  biology—due to that evolution constraint,

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,640
small edits need to lead to meaningful phenotypic  changes—in a relatively favorable regime for

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,200
generic, gradient-like optimizers. It would be a little bit overstating

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,480
to say evolution is using the  gradient, but there is a system.

00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,960
If you've heard of evolution strategies, where  basically the way you optimize parameters

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,320
is you can't take a gradient on your loss. So you make a bunch of copies of your parameters,

00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,560
you randomly modify them, and then you compute  a gradient on your parameters against your loss,

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,320
and so you can take a gradient in that space. That's how I imagine evolution is working.

00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,440
So you need lots of those little edits to actually  lead you to have meaningful step sizes in terms of

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,960
the ultimate output that you have. Interesting. You're just like

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:23,520
designing a little LoRA that goes on top. In a way. Maybe this is getting too

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,040
giga-brained about it, but why does the  genome even have transcription factors?

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,360
What's the point? Why not just have it so every  time you want a new cell type, you engineer some

00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,560
new cassette of genes or some new, totally de  novo set of promoters or something like this?

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,680
One possible explanation for their existence,  rather than just an appreciation for their

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,120
presence, is that having transcription  factors allows a very small number of

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,080
base pair edits at the substrate of the genome  to lead to very large phenotypic differences.

00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,440
If I break a transcription factor, I can  delete a whole cell type in the body.

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,200
If I retarget a transcription factor  to different genes, I can dramatically

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,440
change when cells respond and have hundreds  of their downstream effector genes change

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,680
their behavior in response to the environment. It puts you in this regime where transcription

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,280
factors are a really nice substrate to  manipulate as targets for medicines.

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,880
In some ways they might be evolution's levers  upon the broader architecture of the genome.

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,280
By pulling on those same levers that evolution  has gifted us, there are probably many useful

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,080
things we can engender upon biology. You're sort of hinting that if we

00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,480
analogize it to some code base, we're  going to find a couple of lines that

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,400
are commented out that's like, "de-aging,"  and then "un-hyphen" or "un-parenthesize."

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,720
I don't know about that, but I can give you a  real cringe analogy that sometimes I deploy.

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,840
It requires a very special audience. I think you'll probably be one who fits into it.

00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,320
You're flattering our listeners. "Only  cringe listeners will appreciate it,

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,920
but your audience will love this." I don't know about your audience, but you will.

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,200
You can think about it like this. If you think about how attention works—queries,

00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,880
keys, values—TFs are like the queries. The genome sequences they bind to are like

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,720
the keys. Genes are like the values. It turns  out that that structure then allows you to very

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,960
efficiently, in terms of editing space, change  just one of those embedding vectors, in this case

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,840
one of those sequences, and get dramatically  different performances or total outputs.

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,160
So I do think it's interesting how these  structures recur throughout biology,

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,080
in the same way that the attention mechanism  seems to exist in some neural structures.

00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,280
It's interesting that you can very easily  see how that same sort of querying and

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,200
information storage might exist in the genome. Interesting. A previous guest and a mutual friend,

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,600
Trenton Bricken, had a paper in grad school  about how the brain implements attention.

00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,960
Eddie Chang has found positional encodings  probably exist in humans using neuropixels,

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,160
if you haven't read these papers. He implants these neuropixel probes

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,880
into individuals and then he's able to talk  to them, look at them as they read sentences.

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,920
What he finds is that there seem to be  certain representations which function

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,840
as a positional encoding across sentences. They fire at a certain frequency and it just

00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:03,120
increases as the sentence goes on and then resets. It seems exactly like what we do when

00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,920
we train large language models. It's so funny the way we're going

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,040
to learn how the brain works is just trying to  first-principles engineer intelligence in AI.

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,720
Then it just happens to be the case that each  one of these things has a neural correlate.

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,760
If you're right that transcription factors are  the modality evolution has used to have complex

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,920
phenotypic effects, optimize for different  things... Two-part question. One, why haven't

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,840
pathogens, which have a strong interest in  having complex phenotypic effects on your body,

00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:51,920
also utilized the transcription factors as the  way to fuck you over and steal your resources?

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,360
Two, we've been trying to  design drugs for centuries.

00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,760
Why aren't all the big drugs, the  top-selling drugs, ones that just

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,000
modulate transcription factors? Why don't we have a million of these pills?

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,360
I'll try and take those in stride. They're pretty  different answers. The first answer is that there

00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,960
are pathogens that utilize transcription  factors as part of their life cycle.

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,200
A famous example of this is HIV. HIV encodes a protein called Tat,

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,840
and Tat actually activates NF-κB. HIV, to back up a little bit, is a retrovirus.

00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:28,320
It starts out as RNA, turns itself into DNA,  shoves itself into the genome of your CD4+ T cells

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,240
It needs this ornate machinery to  actually control when it makes more

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,560
HIV and when it goes latent so it can hide  and your immune system can't clear it out.

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,640
This is why HIV is so pernicious. You can kill every single cell in the body that's

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,040
actively making HIV with a really good drug. But then a few of them that have lingered

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,720
and hunkered down just turn back on. People call this the latent reservoir.

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,760
Similar to Hep B, right? Hep B, Hep C, can both

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,520
do this sort of latent behavior. HIV is probably the most pernicious of these.

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,800
One way it does it is that this gene  called Tat actually interacts with NF-κB.

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,640
NF-κB is a master transcription  factor within immune cells.

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,960
Typically if I'm going to horribly reduce  what it does, and some immunologists can

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,560
crucify me later, it increases the  inflammatory response of most cells.

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,480
They become more likely to attack given  pathogens around them on the margin.

00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,680
It'll turn on NF-κB activity and then  use that to drive its own transcription

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,560
and its own life cycle. I can't remember quite

00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,320
all the details now exactly of how it works. But part of this circuitry is what allows it

00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,560
to—in some subset of cells where some of that  upstream transcription factor machinery in the

00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,440
host might be deactivated—it goes latent. As long as the population of cells it's

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,360
infecting always has a few that are turning  off the transcription factors upstream that

00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,440
drive its own transcription, then HIV is  able to persist in this latent reservoir

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,080
within human cells. It's just one example  offhand. There are a number of other pathogens.

00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,640
Unfortunately, I don't have quite as  much molecular detail in some of these.

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,680
But they will interface with other parts of the  cell that eventually result in transcription

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,440
factor translocation to the nucleus and  then transcription factors being active.

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,320
This actually segues a little  bit to your second question on

00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,840
why there aren’t more medicines targeting TFs. In a way many of our medicines, ultimately

00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,360
downstream, are leading to changes in TF activity,  but we haven't been able to directly target them

00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,680
due to their physical location within cells. So we go several layers upstream.

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,680
If you think about how a cell works in sensing its  environment, it has many receptors on the surface.

00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,960
It has the ability to sense mechanical  tension and things like this.

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,200
Ultimately, most of what these signaling pathways  lead to is to tell the cell, "Use some different

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,040
genes than you're using right now." That's  often what's occurring. That ultimately leads

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,120
to transcription factors being some of the  final effectors in these signaling cascades.

00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:43,680
A lot of the drugs we have that, for instance,  inhibit a particular cytokine that might bind a

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,280
receptor, or they block that receptor directly,  or maybe they hit a certain signaling pathway…

00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,560
Ultimately, the way that they're exerting  their effect is then downstream of that

00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,960
signaling pathway, some transcription factor  is either being turned on or not turned on.

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,720
You're using different genes in the cell. We're kind of taking these crazy bank shots

00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,000
because we can't hit the TFs directly. That sort of begs the question,

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,320
"Why can't you just go after the TF directly?" Traditionally, we use what are called small

00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,560
molecule drugs, where they're  defined just by their size.

00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,120
The reason they have to be small is they  need to be small enough to wiggle through

00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,960
the membrane of a cell and get inside. Then you run into a challenge.

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,200
If you want to actually stick a small molecule  between two proteins that have a pretty big

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,600
interface—meaning they've got big swaths on  the side of them that all sort of line up and

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,880
form a synapse with one another—then you would  need a big molecule in order to inhibit that.

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,120
It turns out that TF's binding  DNA is a pretty darn big surface.

00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,520
Small molecules aren't great at disrupting  that and certainly even worse at activating it.

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,760
Small molecules can get all  the way into the nucleus,

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,360
but they can't do much once they're there.  They're just too small. The other classic

00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,920
modalities we have are recombinant proteins. We make a protein like a hormone in a big vat.

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,600
We grow it in some Chinese hamster ovary  cells, we extract it, we inject it into you.

00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,640
This is how, for instance, human  insulin works that we make today.

00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,360
Or you make antibodies  produced by the immune system.

00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,640
These run around and find proteins that  have a particular sequence, they bind to it,

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,800
and often they just stop it from working  by glomming a big thing onto the side.

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,640
Those are too big to get  through the cell membrane.

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,880
Then they can't actually get to  a TF or do anything directly.

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,560
So we take these bank shots. What changes that today, and why

00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,040
I think it's pretty exciting, is we now have new  nucleic acid and genetic medicines where you can,

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,600
for instance, deliver RNAs to a cell that can get  through using tricks like lipid nanoparticles.

00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,080
You wrap them in a fat bubble. It looks kind of like a cell membrane.

00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,640
It can fuse with a cell, and  put the mRNAs in the cytosol.

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
You can make a copy of a  transcription factor there,

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,800
and then it translocates to the nucleus the same  way a natural one would and exerts its effect.

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,760
Likewise, there are other ways to do  this using things like viral vectors,

00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,400
but we've only very recently actually gotten the  tools we need to start addressing transcription

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,960
factors as first-class targets rather  than treating them as maybe some ancillary

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,040
third-order thing that's going to happen. Interesting. So the drugs we have can't

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,280
target them, but your claim is that a lot  of drugs actually do work by binding to

00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,160
the things we actually can target and those  have some effect on transcription factors.

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,520
This brings us to questions about delivery,  which is the next thing I want to ask you.

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,840
You mentioned lipid nanoparticles. This  is what the COVID vaccines were made of.

00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:17,680
The ultimate question if we're going to work on  de-aging… Even if you identify what is the right

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,720
transcription factor to de-age a cell, and even  if they're shared across cell types, or you figure

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,880
out the right one for every single cell type, how  do you get it to every single cell in the body?

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,080
How do you deliver stuff?  How do you get them in there?

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,480
There are many ways one could imagine solving it. I'll narrow the scope of the problem.

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,040
Delivering nucleic acid is a  pretty good first-order primitive.

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,800
Ultimately, the genome is nucleic acids, the  RNAs that come out of it are nucleic acids.

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,840
If you can get nucleic acid into  a cell, you can drug pretty much

00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,880
anything in the genome effectively. You can reduce this problem to asking,

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,560
"How do I get nucleic acids wherever I want  them to any cell type very specifically?"

00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,680
Today, there are two main modalities that  people use, both of which have some downsides.

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,720
The first one that we've touched on already  is lipid nanoparticles. These are basically

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,680
fat bubbles. By default, they get taken up  by tissues which take up fat, like the liver.

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,600
They can be used like trojan horses. They can release some arbitrary nucleic

00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,120
acid—usually RNA, maybe encoding your  favorite genes, in our case, transcription

00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,800
factors—into the cell types of interest. You can play with the fats, and you can

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,560
also tie stuff onto the outside of the fat. You can attach part of an antibody, for example,

00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,680
to make it go to different cell types in the body. The field is making a lot of progress on being

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,680
able to target various different  cell types with lipid nanoparticles.

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,000
Even if nothing else worked for the next  several decades, companies like ours would

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,920
have more than enough problems to solve  with the cells that we can actually target.

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,720
Another prominent way people go  after this is using viral vectors.

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,280
The basic idea being viruses  had a lot of evolutionary

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,800
history and very large population sizes. They've evolved to get into our cells.

00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,760
Maybe we can learn something from  them, even better than Trojan horses.

00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,240
One type of virus people use a lot is called an  AAV. Those AAVs carry DNA genomes. You can get

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,600
genes, whole genes, into cells. They've  got some packaging sizes. You can think

00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,800
of it like a very small delivery truck, so  you can't put everything you want into it.

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,720
They can go to certain cell types as well. On top of just where you actually get the

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,760
nucleic acid to begin with, you can  engineer the sequences a bit, and that

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,680
basically allows you to add a NOT gate on it. You can make it turn off the nucleic acid in

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,400
certain cell types, but you're never  going to use the sequence engineering

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,680
to get nucleic acid into cells where it  didn't get delivered in the first place.

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,320
You can start broad with your delivery vector  and then use sequence to narrow down to make it

00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,120
more specific, but not the other way around. Both of those methods are super promising.

00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,600
If nothing else emerged for decades, we'd  still have tons and tons of problems as a

00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,960
therapeutic development community  to solve, even using just those.

00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,360
I have one very controversial opinion  which people can roast me for later.

00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,480
You have just one? You're trying to  solve aging and you have only one?

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,040
I have many controversial opinions. One of  them is that both of these probably in the

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,120
limit will not be the way that we're  delivering medicines in the year 2100.

00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,520
If you think about viral vectors, no matter what,

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,080
they're always going to be  some amount of immunogenic.

00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
You're always going to have your  immune system trying to fight them off.

00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,600
You can play tricks, you can try and cloak  them, etc., but they're always going to have

00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,720
some toxicity risk. They also don't go everywhere.  It's not that we have examples of a single viral

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,880
species that infects every cell type in the body  and we just need to engineer it to make it safe.

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,720
We would have to also engineer the virus  to go to new cell types. There's some

00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,640
limitations there. LNPs likewise have some  problems. They can go to tons of cell types.

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,520
That's largely what we're working on.  We're super excited about it. But there

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,080
are some physical constraints. They just have a certain size.

00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,720
They have to get from your bloodstream out of  your bloodstream toward a given target cell,

00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,680
and they have to not fuse into any  of the other cells along the way.

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,520
There's a whole gamut they have to run. Ultimately, we're probably going to have

00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,960
to solve delivery the way that  our own genome solved delivery.

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,200
We have the same problem  that arose during evolution.

00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,840
How do I patrol the body, find  arbitrary signals in the environment,

00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,280
and then deliver some important cargo  there when some set of events happens?

00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,480
How do I find a specific place and only  near those cell types release my cargo?

00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,880
The problem was solved by the immune system. We have cell types in our body,

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,000
T cells and B cells, which are effectively  engineered by evolution to run around,

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,920
invaginate whatever tissues they need to. They can climb almost anywhere in the body.

00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,720
There's nowhere they can't get access to, almost. Once they sense a particular set of signals—and

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,160
they've got a very ornate circuitry to  do this, they run basically an AND gate

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,040
logic—they can release a specified payload. Right now, the way our genome sets them up,

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,480
the payload they release is largely either  enzymes that will kill some cell that they're

00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,560
targeting or kill some pathogen, or some signal  flares that call in other parts of the immune

00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,960
system to do the same thing. So that's super  cool. But you can think about it as a modular

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,560
system that evolution's already gifted us. We've got some signal and environmental

00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,960
recognition systems so we can find particular  areas of the body that we want to find.

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,800
Then we have some sort of payload delivery system. I can deliver some arbitrary set of things.

00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,120
I imagine if we were to Rip Van Winkle  ourselves into 2100 and wake up,

00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,680
the way we will be delivering these nucleic acid  payloads is actually by engineering cells to do

00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,360
it, to perform this very ornate function. Those cells might actually live with you.

00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,600
You probably will get engrafted with them, and  they might persist with you for many years.

00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,080
They deliver the medicine only  when the environment within your

00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,800
body actually dictates that you need it. You actually won't be seeing a physician

00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,520
every time this medicine is active. Rather, you'll have a more ornate,

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,160
responsive circuit. The other exciting thing about cells

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,120
is that they're big and they have big genomes. You actually have a large palette to encode

00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,760
complex infrastructure and complex circuitry. You don't need to limit yourself to the very small

00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,400
RNAs you can get in that might encode a gene or  two, or in our case, a few transcription factors.

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,240
You don't have to limit yourself to this  tiny AAV genome that's only a few kilobases.

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,000
You've got billions of base pairs to play  with in terms of encoding all your logic.

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,720
So I think that's ultimately  how delivery will get solved.

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,640
We've got many, many stepping  stones along the way.

00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,960
But if I could clone myself and work on an even  riskier endeavor, that's probably what I would do.

00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,440
In a way, we treat cancer this  way with CAR-T therapy, right?

00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,920
We take the T cells out and then we tell them to  go find a cancer with this receptor and kill it.

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,840
Is the reason that works that the cancer  cells we're trying to target are also free

00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,120
floating in the blood? Is that what it  targets? Basically, could this deliver to

00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:17,440
literally every single cell in the body? Not literally every single cell. I'll

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,560
asterisk it there. For example,  T cells don't go into your brain.

00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,320
They can, but it's generally a  pathology when they get in there.

00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,920
It's not literally every cell, but  almost every cell in your body is

00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,800
surveilled by the immune system. There are very, very few what we

00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,120
call immune-privileged compartments in your body. It's things like the joints of your knees and your

00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,200
shoulders, your eyeball, and your brain. There might be a couple of others.

00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,480
The ear probably falls into that category. A funny way of thinking about this is that all

00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,400
the gene-therapy people using viruses, they want  to deliver to the immune-privileged compartments

00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,360
because their drugs are immunogenic, and they're  limited to a very, very small set of diseases.

00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,800
In a way, it's like the shadow of all the  diseases you can't address with viruses

00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,920
is what you can address with cells. Given the complementarity between them,

00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,640
you can probably cover the entire body.  They can't literally go everywhere. But your

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,760
analogy to the CAR-T work is very apt as well. You can think about that two-component system.

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,840
I've got some detection mechanism for  the environment I want to sense to

00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,440
perform some function, and then I have  some sort of payload that I deliver.

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,600
CAR-Ts engineer the first of those and leave the  second exactly the same as the immune system does.

00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,360
They engineer—go recognize this other  antigen that you wouldn't usually target,

00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,520
some protein on the surface of a cell, for  instance—and then deliver the payload you would

00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,120
usually deliver if it was infected by a virus  or if you saw that it was foreign in some way.

00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,600
Whereas cancer cells usually  don't actually look that foreign.

00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,040
Most of their genes are the same genes that are  in your normal genome, and that's why it's hard

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,080
for the immune system to surveil it. Interesting. Interesting. It's funny

00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,400
that whenever we're trying to cure infectious  diseases, we just have to deal with, "Fuck,

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,760
viruses have been evolving for billions of years  with our oldest common ancestor, and they know

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,720
exactly what they're doing, and it's so hard." Then whenever we're trying to do something else,

00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,160
we're like, "Fuck, the immune system has been  evolving for billions of years, and it knows

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,360
what it's doing, and how do we get past it?" The Red Queen race is quite sophisticated.

00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,400
If you want to just throw a new  tool into biology, you somehow have

00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,320
to get around one side of that equation. Given the fact that it's somewhere between

00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:22,240
impossible and very far away but it's necessary  for full curing of aging, does that mean that in

00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,680
the short run, in the next few decades, we'll  have some parts of our body which will have

00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:33,120
these amazing therapies, and then other parts  which will just be stuck the way they are?

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,560
You mentioned hepatocytes are some of the  cells that you're able to actually study in

00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,440
or deliver to. These are our liver cells. So  you're saying, "Look, I can get drunk as much

00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,760
as I want and it's not going to have an impact on  my long-run liver health because then you'll just

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,480
inject me with this therapy." But for the rest of my body,

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,600
it's going to age as normal? What is the implication of the

00:59:53,600 --> 01:00:00,240
fact that the delivery seems to be lagging  much behind your understanding of aging?

01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,000
Just to give the delivery folks  credit, they're currently ahead.

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,720
There are currently no reprogramming  medicines for aging, and there are

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,440
medicines that deliver nucleic acids. They're still winning the race against

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:16,320
us right now, but to your point, I hope the  lines cross. I hope we outcompete them. Even

01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:21,600
if you were able to only target some subsets of  cells, it's not that you would see this strange,

01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,880
Frankensteinian benefit in health in some  aspects and lack of benefit entirely in others.

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,760
What we've found across the history  of medicine is that the body's an

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,320
incredibly interconnected, complex system. If you're able to rescue function even in

01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,400
one cell type in one tissue, you often  have knock-on benefits in many places

01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,400
that you didn't initially anticipate. One way we can get examples of this

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,640
is through transplant experiments. Both in bone marrow and in liver,

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,440
for example, we have fairly common  transplant procedures that occur in humans.

01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,120
We can compare old humans who get livers  from young people or old people and ask a

01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,360
pretty controlled question. What occurs as a function

01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,200
of just having a young liver? Is it that, for example, you can eat a

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,920
lot of fatty food and drink a lot and be fine? Or is it that you see broader benefits?

01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,640
The latter seems to be true. They have reduced risk of

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,160
several other diseases and overall better  survival as a function of having a younger

01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,160
liver than they do for an older one. Suggesting that because these tissues

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,880
are so interconnected, many of  these organs like the liver,

01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,560
like your adipose tissue, are endocrine organs. They're also sending out signals to many other

01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,640
places in your body, helping coordinate  your health across multiple tissue systems.

01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,400
Even just one tissue can benefit other tissue  systems in your body at the same time. HSCs are

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:44,640
another example. These are mostly examples taken  from a wonderful book by Frederick Appelbaum,

01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,920
who trained with Don Thomas, the physician  who invented human bone marrow transplants.

01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,000
There are many circumstances where patients  got a bone marrow transplant and actually

01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,640
cured another disease they had as a result,  maybe unanticipated, where it's even just the

01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,120
replacement of this one special cell type, HSCs,  that has knock-on effects throughout the body.

01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,560
There were symptoms of these diseases that  presented in myriad ways throughout their

01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,320
system, but ultimately, its root  cause was even just a single cell.

01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,560
There are counterexamples as well where you  can go into animals and break even just one

01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:18,880
gene in one specific subset of T cells. You can break a gene in there that encodes

01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,080
for a transcription factor in their  mitochondria called TFAM, and you

01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:27,120
dramatically shorten the lifespan of mice. One gene in one special type of T cells

01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,280
can give you that type of pathology. So it implies the inverse may also exist.

01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,680
Is this related to why Ozempic has so  many downstream positive effects that

01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,760
seem even not totally related to its  effects just on making you leaner?

01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,880
I think it's one example. It is a hormone,  and your endocrine system coordinates a lot

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,920
of the complex interplay between your tissues. I don't think the story is fully written yet

01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,600
on exactly why GLP-1 and GIP-1, broadly  incretin mimetic medicines like Ozempic,

01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,600
have so many knock-on benefits, but  they're a great example of this phenomenon.

01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,640
If someone told you, "I'm going to find a  single molecule, and I'm going to drug it,

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,880
and it's not only going to have benefits for  weight loss but also for cardiovascular disease,

01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,640
also possibly for addictive behavior, and  maybe even preventing neurodegeneration,"

01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,560
you would have told them they were crazy. Yet, just by acting on the small number of

01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,640
cells in your body which are receiving this  signal, the interplay and the communication

01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,880
between those cells and the rest of your body  seems to have many of these knock-on benefits.

01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,520
It's just one existence proof that  very small numbers of cells in your

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,800
body can have health benefits everywhere. Even if cellular delivery does not emerge by 2100,

01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,280
as I imagine it will, I still think that  you're going to have the ability to add

01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,360
decades of healthy life to individuals  by reprogramming the age of individual

01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,200
cell types and individual tissues. How big will the payload have to be?

01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,640
How many transcription factors? I  think it's just a countable number.

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,280
Some of those that we've found today that have  efficacy are somewhere between one and five.

01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
That's a small enough number that you can  encapsulate it in current mRNA medicines.

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,760
Already in the clinic today, there are medicines  that deliver many different genes as RNA.

01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,440
There are medicines where, for instance, it's  a vaccine as a combination of flu and COVID

01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,000
proteins, and they're delivering 20 different  unique transcripts all at the same time.

01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,360
When you think about that already as a  medicine that's being injected into people

01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:22,640
in trials, the idea of delivering just a few  transcription factors is seemingly quotidian.

01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,760
Thankfully, I don't think we'll be limited by  the size of the payloads that one can deliver.

01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,640
One other really cool thing about transcription  factors is that the endogenous biology is

01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,880
very favorable for drug development. The expression level of transcription

01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,960
factors in your genome relative  to other genes is incredibly low.

01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,280
If you just look at the rank-ordered list of what  are the most frequently expressed genes in the

01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,000
genome by the count of how many mRNAs are in the  cell, transcription factors are near the bottom.

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,200
That means you don't actually need to get  that many copies of a transcription factor

01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,080
into a cell in order to have benefits. What we've seen so far, and what I

01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:02,080
imagine will continue to play out, is that  even fairly low doses of these medicines,

01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:07,440
which are well within the realm of what folks  have been taking for more than a decade.

01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:13,120
They are able to induce really strong efficacy. We're hopeful that not only will the actual size

01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,680
of the payload in terms of number  of base pairs not be limiting,

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,120
but the dose shouldn't be limiting either. Would it have to be a chronic treatment,

01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,080
or could it just be a one-time dose? In principle, it could be one time.

01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,480
I think that would be an overstatement for today. I can talk you through the evidence from the

01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,240
first principles back to the reality of  what's the hardest thing we have in hand.

01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,640
Epigenetic reprogramming is basically how the  cell types in our bodies right now are able

01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,520
to adopt the identities that they have. The existence proof that those epigenetic

01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,840
reprogramming events can last decades is that my  tongue doesn't spontaneously turn into a kidney.

01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:50,720
These epigenetic marks can persist for  decades throughout a human life, or hundreds

01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,960
of years if you want to take the example of a  bowhead whale which uses the same mechanism.

01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,040
We also know that with very targeted edits,  other groups have done this, folks like Luke

01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,840
Gilbert now at the Arc Institute, who I think of  as one of the great unsung scientists of our time,

01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,680
have been able to make a targeted edit in  a single locus and then show that you can

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:14,640
actually make cells divide 400-plus times over  multiple years in an incubator in the lab.

01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,720
Imagine a hothouse where you're just trying  as hard as you can to break this mark down,

01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,120
and it can actually persist for many years. Other companies have actually now dosed

01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,880
some editors similar to the ones that  Luke developed in his lab in monkeys

01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,200
and shown they last at least a couple of years. In principle, the upper bound here is really long.

01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,520
You could potentially have one dose and it  lasts a very long time, potentially decades, as

01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,760
long as it took you to age the first time maybe. We don't have data like that today. I don't want

01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,840
to overstate. We do have data that these positive  effects can last several weeks after a dose.

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,400
You could imagine, even without many leaps  of faith up toward this upper bound limit

01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,600
of what's possible just from the data we have in  hand now, that you could get doses every month,

01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,840
every few months and actually have really  dramatic benefits that persist over time,

01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:03,360
rather than needing to get an IV every  day, which might not be tractable.

01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,160
We've got 1600 transcription  factors in the human genome.

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,880
Is it worth looking at non-human TFs  and seeing what effects they might have,

01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,280
or are they unlikely to be the right search space? I think it's less likely. I think you have a prior

01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,840
that evolution has given you a reasonable  basis set for navigating the states that

01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,360
human cells might want to occupy. In our case, we know that the state

01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,360
we're trying to access is encoded  by some combination of these TFs.

01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,640
It does arise in development obviously. We're trying to make an old cell look young,

01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,600
not look like some Frankenstein  cell that's never been seen before.

01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:40,160
That said, we don't have any guarantees that the  way aging progresses is by following the same

01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,760
basis set of these transcription factor programs  in the genome that are encoded during development.

01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,080
I don't think it's unreasonable to ask, "Would  your eventual ideal reprogramming medicine

01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:55,280
necessarily be a composition of the natural TFs,  or would it include something like TFs from other

01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,120
organisms, as you posit, or even entirely  synthetic transcription factors as well?"

01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,840
Things like Super-SOX. Super-SOX is  a particular publication from Sergiy

01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:11,520
Velychko where they mutated the SOX2 gene and  they made more efficient iPSC reprogramming.

01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,440
They could take somatic cells and turn them  into pluripotent stem cells more effectively

01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:22,400
than you could with just the canonical Yamanaka  factors, which are Oct-4, Sox2, KLF4, and Myc.

01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,560
iPSC reprogramming never happens in nature,  so there's no reason to necessarily believe

01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,000
that the natural TFs are optimal. So even really simple optimizations,

01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,520
like just mutagenizing one of the four  Yamanaka factors we already know about

01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,760
or swapping some domains between a few  TFs, seem to improve things dramatically.

01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,760
I think that's a pretty good signal that  actually there's a lot of gradient to climb

01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,200
here and that potentially for us, the end-state  products we're developing in 2100 are more like

01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,280
synthetic genes that have never existed, rather  than just compositions of the natural set.

01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:57,520
What about the effects of aging? Your skin starts to sag because of the

01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,800
effects of gravity over the course of decades? Is  that a cellular process? How would some cellular

01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,800
therapy deal with that? The best evidence is

01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,760
that it's probably not cellular. The reason your skin sags is there's a protein

01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,040
in your skin called elastin, which does exactly  what you'd think it would based on the name.

01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,200
It kind of keeps your skin elastic-y, like  a waistband, and holds it to your face.

01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,960
You have these big polymerized  fibers of elastin in your face.

01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,440
As far as we understand it, you only polymerize  it and form a long fiber during development.

01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,400
Then the rest of your life, you make  the individual units of the polymer,

01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,240
but for reasons no one as far as I can  tell understands, they fail to polymerize.

01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,000
You can't make new long cords to  hold your skin up to your face.

01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,720
So the eventual solution for something like  that is likely that you need to program cells

01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,640
to states that are extra-physiological. There might not be a cell in your body.

01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,400
It's not just like a young skin cell from a  20-year-old is better at making these fibers.

01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,560
As far as we can tell, they don't. But you could probably program a cell to

01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,720
be able to reinvigorate that polymerization  process, to run along the fiber and repair

01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,000
it in places where it's damaged. Obviously these things get made

01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,680
during development, so it's totally  physically feasible for this to occur.

01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,080
Maybe there's even a developmental  state which would be sufficient to

01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,000
achieve this. I don't think anyone knows. But  that would be the kind of state that one might

01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,560
have to engineer de novo, even if our genome  doesn't necessarily encode for it explicitly.

01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:18,640
Interesting. Okay, what is Eroom's Law? Eroom's Law is a funny portmanteau created

01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,400
by a friend of mine, Jack Scannell. He inverted the notion of Moore's Law,

01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:27,520
which is the doubling of compute density  on silicon chips every few years.

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,560
Moore's Law has graciously given  us massive increases in compute

01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,400
performance over several decades. Eroom's Law is the inverse of that.

01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,320
In biopharma, what we're actually seeing  is that there's a very consistent decrease

01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,840
in the number of new molecular entities,  new medicines that we're able to invent,

01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,800
per billion dollars invested. This trend actually starts way

01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,440
back in the 1950s and persists through many  different technological transitions along the way.

01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,640
It seems to be an incredibly consistent  feature of trying to make new medicines.

01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,120
In a weird way, Eroom's Law is actually  very similar to the scaling laws you

01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,960
have in ML, where you have this very  consistent logarithmic relationship.

01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,440
You throw in more inputs and you get  consistently diminishing outputs.

01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:15,200
The difference, of course, is that this trend  in ML has been used to raise exponentially more

01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:22,960
investment and to drive more hype towards AI. Whereas in biotech, modulo NewLimit's new round,

01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,240
it has driven down valuations,  driven down excitement and energy.

01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,040
With AI at least you can internalize the extra  cost and the extra benefits because there's

01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,400
this general purpose model you're training. This year you spend $100 million training

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,640
a model, next year $1 billion,  the year after that, $10 billion.

01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,720
But it's one general purpose model, unlike, "We  made money on this drug and now we're going to

01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,840
use that money to invest in 10 different  drugs in 10 different bespoke ways."

01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:50,480
I was gearing up to ask you, what would a general  purpose platform—where even if you had diminishing

01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,920
returns, at least you can have this less bespoke  way of designing drugs—look like for biotech?

01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,880
I'm going to slightly dodge your question  first to maybe analyze something really

01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,760
interesting that you highlighted. You have these two phenomena:

01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,600
ML scaling and then scaling in terms  of the cost for new drug discovery.

01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,240
Why is it that the patterns of  investment have been so different?

01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,880
There are probably two key features  that might explain this difference.

01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,040
One is that the returns to the scaled  output in the case of ML actually are

01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,080
expected to increase super exponentially. If you actually reach AGI, it's going to be a much

01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:25,120
larger value than just even a few logs back on  the performance curve that people are following.

01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,720
Whereas in the life sciences thus  far, each of those products we're

01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,240
generating further and further out on the  Eroom's Law curve as time moves forward,

01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,880
haven't necessarily scaled in their potential  revenue and their potential returns quite so much.

01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,400
You're seeing these increased costs  not counterbalanced by increased ROI.

01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,800
The other piece of it that you highlighted is  that it’s unlike building a general model where

01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,040
potentially by making larger investments, you can  be able to solve a broader addressable market,

01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,480
moving from solving very narrow  tasks to eventually replacing large

01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,880
fractions of white collar intelligence. In biotech, when you're traditionally

01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,920
able to develop a medicine in a given  indication—"I was able to treat disease

01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,040
X"—it doesn't necessarily engender you to be  able to then treat "disease Y" more readily.

01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,360
Typically where these biotech firms in general  have been able to develop unique expertise is on

01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,520
making molecules to target particular genes,  so "I'm really good at making a molecule

01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,160
that intervenes on gene X or gene Y." It turns out that the ability to make

01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:22,320
those molecules more rapidly isn't actually  reducing the largest risk in the process.

01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,560
This means that the ability to go from  one or two outputs one year to then

01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,840
four the next is much more limited. This brings us then to the question

01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,200
of what the general model would be in biology. I think it reduces down to how do you actually

01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:41,440
imbue those two properties that create the ML  scaling law curve of hope and bring those over

01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,120
to biology so that you can take the Eroom's  law curve and potentially give it the same

01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,280
sort of potential beneficial spin. There are a few different versions

01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,240
of this you could imagine. But I'll address the first point.

01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:55,840
How do you get to a place where you're  actually able to generate more revenue per

01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,640
medicine so that potentially the outputs  you're generating are more valuable,

01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:03,280
even if each output might cost a bit more? Traditionally, when we've developed medicines,

01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:09,040
we go after fairly narrow indications, meaning  diseases that fairly small numbers of people get.

01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:14,000
That's actually increased, in terms of the  narrow scope of what medicines are addressing,

01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,680
as we've gone forward in time. This is sort of an ironic situation

01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,280
where we've gone from addressing pretty broad  categories of disease, like infectious disease,

01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,520
to narrower and narrower genetically-defined  diseases that have small patient populations.

01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,600
Because these only affect a few people—if you  think about the value function of a medicine as

01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,280
how many years of healthy life it gives how many  people—if the "how many people" is pretty small,

01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,080
it just really bounds the amount  of value you're able to generate.

01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,520
You need to then be able to find  medicines that treat most people.

01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,680
All of us will one day get sick and die. So arguably, the TAM for any really successful

01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:48,240
medicine could be everybody on planet Earth. We need to find a way to be able to route

01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,200
toward medicines that address  these very large populations.

01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,280
The second piece then is, how do we  actually build models that enable us

01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,280
to take the success in one medicine we've  developed and lead that to an increased

01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,040
probability of success on the next medicine? Traditionally, we haven't been able to do that.

01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,360
Maybe you're better at making an antibody for gene  Y because you made one for gene X five years ago.

01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,360
But it turns out making an antibody isn't  really the hard part of drug discovery.

01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,120
Figuring out what to make an antibody to  target is the hard thing about drug discovery.

01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,920
What gene do I intervene upon in order to  actually treat a disease in a given patient?

01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,000
Most of the time, we just don't know. That's why even if a given drug firm

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,440
becomes very good at making antibodies to  gene X and they have a successful approval,

01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,840
when they then go to treat disease Y they  don't necessarily know what gene to go after.

01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,640
Most of the risk is not in how to make an antibody  to treat my particular target, it's in figuring

01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,840
out what to target in the first place. I'm not sure how to understand this

01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:49,120
claim that we know how to engage with  the right hook, we just don't know

01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,640
what that hook is supposed to do in the body. I don't know if that's the way you describe it.

01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,520
Another claim that I've seen is that with small  molecules we have this Goldilocks problem.

01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,840
They have to be small enough to percolate  through the body and through cell walls,

01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,200
etc., but big enough to interfere  with protein-protein interactions that

01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,720
transcription factors might have. There it seems like getting the

01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,240
hook is the big problem. In this particular case,

01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:18,800
if we bound ourselves to, "We must use small  molecules as our modality," then there are lots

01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,720
of targets which are very difficult to drug. There are many other modalities by which you

01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,840
can drug some of these genes. I would say–I don't have formal

01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,960
way of explaining this–if you were to write  out a list of well-known targets that many,

01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,360
many folks would agree are the correct genes to  go after and to try and inhibit or activate in

01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,040
order to treat a given set of diseases—and  the only reason we don't have medicines is

01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,040
that we can't figure out a trick in order to  be able to drug them—it's a fairly small list.

01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,880
It would probably fit on a single page. Whereas the number of possible indications

01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,560
that one could go after, and the number  of possible genes that one could intervene

01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,520
upon especially when you consider  their combinations, is astronomical.

01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:58,240
The experiment you could run here is if you  lock 10 really smart drug developers in a room.

01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:03,360
You tell them to write down some incredibly  high-conviction target disease pairs where

01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,560
they're sure if they modulate this biology,  these patients are going to benefit.

01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,120
All they need is some molecular hook, as  you put it, in order to do this. It's a

01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,200
relatively short list. What you're not going  to get is anything approximating the panoply

01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,320
of human pathologies that develop. You can actually look for this.

01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,640
There are some existence proofs you  can look for out in the universe.

01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,320
If the only problem was that we didn't have  the ability to drug something using current

01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,240
therapeutics that we can put in humans, we  should still be able to treat it in the best

01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:34,160
animal models of that disease because we  can use things like transgenic systems.

01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:37,360
You can go in and you can engineer  the genome of that animal.

01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,560
This gives you all sorts of superpowers that  you don't have in patients, but allow you to,

01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,920
for instance, turn on arbitrarily complex groups  of genes in arbitrarily specific or broad groups

01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,160
of cells in the organism, at any time you  want, at any dose you want in the animal.

01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:54,000
For the majority of pathologies, we  just don't have many of those examples.

01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,840
What is the answer to what is the general purpose  thing where every marginal discovery increases the

01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,600
odds you make the next discovery? There are multiple ways one might

01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,160
approach this problem. The most common today,

01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,200
this is often what people are describing  when they talk about a virtual cell.

01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:17,280
This is a very nebulous idea, sometimes numinous,  if you'll let me describe it in that way as well.

01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:22,720
Concretely, what most people are trying  to do is measure some number of molecules,

01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:28,400
or perceived emissions like the morphology of  a cell, and then perturb it many times, turn

01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,680
some genes on, turn some genes off, and measure  how that molecular morphological state changes.

01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,480
The notion is that there's a lot  of mutual information in biology.

01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,560
If I measure something, most commonly all the  genes the cell is using at a given moment,

01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,800
which you can get by RNA sequencing,  I get a decent enough picture of

01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,000
most of the other complexity going on. I can take a bunch of healthy cells and a bunch

01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,800
of cells that are in a diseased or aged state. I'm able then to compare those profiles and say,

01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,080
"Okay, my diseased cells use these  genes, my healthy cells use these.

01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,600
Are there any interventions that I'm  able to experimentally find in the

01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,040
lab that shift one toward the other?" The hope would be that, because you're

01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,080
never going to be able to scan combinatorially all  the possible groups of genes to make it concrete.

01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:15,840
There's something like 20,000 genes in the genome. You can then choose however many

01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,200
genes in your combination you want. It's not crazy to think of hundreds at a time.

01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,960
That's what transcription factors control. That's  how development works. So the number of possible

01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,760
combinations is truly astronomical. You just can't test it all.

01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,600
The hope would be that by doing some sparse  sampling of those pairs—what your inputs are,

01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,320
here's what the cell looked like  beforehand, here's the particular

01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,560
genes I perturbed—you have some measurement  then of the state that the cell resulted in.

01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,200
Here's which genes went  up, here's which went down.

01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,480
Once I've trained a model to predict from  the perturbations to the output on the cell

01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,760
state, you can start to ask what would happen  for some arbitrary combinations of genes.

01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,920
Now in silico I can search all possible  things that one might do and potentially

01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,840
discover targets that take my diseased  cells back to something like healthy cells.

01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,880
So that's another version  of what an all-encompassing

01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,400
model would look like where you actually  have compounding returns in drug discovery.

01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,040
You basically described one of the models  you guys are working on at NewLimit.

01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,320
You're training this model based  on this data where you're taking

01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:17,120
the entire transcriptome and just labeling  it based on how old that cell actually is.

01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,760
If you've got all this data you're collecting  on how different perturbations are having

01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:29,200
different phenotypic effects on a  cell, why only record whether that

01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:35,520
effect correlates with more or less aging? Why can't you also label it with all the other

01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:41,520
effects that we might eventually care about  and eventually get the full virtual cell?

01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:48,640
That's a more general purpose model, not just the  one that predicts whether a cell looks old or not.

01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:54,240
Absolutely, we actually do both today. We can train these models where the inputs

01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:58,480
are a notion of what that cell looked like at  the starting place, here's what a generic old

01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,240
cell looked like, and then representations  of the transcription factors themselves.

01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,840
We derive those from protein foundation models. They're language models trained

01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,160
on protein sequences. It turns out that gives you a

01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:13,280
really good base level understanding of biology. The model's starting from a pretty smart place.

01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:17,040
Then you can predict a number of different targets  from some learned embedding, the same way you

01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,360
could have multiple heads on a language model. One of those for us is actually just predicting

01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,040
every gene the cell is expressing. Can I just recapitulate the entire state

01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,880
and guess what effect these transcription  factors will have on every given gene?

01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,720
You can think about that as an objective  rather than a value judgment on the cell.

01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,440
I'm not asking whether or not I  want this particular transcriptome.

01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,080
I'm just asking what it will look like. Then we also have something more like

01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,160
value judgments. I believe that that

01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,240
transcriptome looks like a younger cell. I'm going to select on that and train ahead

01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,920
to predict it where I can denoise across  genes and then select for younger cells.

01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,320
But you could do that for arbitrary  numbers of additional heads.

01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,080
What are some other states you might want? Do I want to polarize T cells to a less

01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,040
inflammatory state in somebody  with an autoimmune disease?

01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:03,440
Do I want to make liver cells more functional  in a patient who's suffering from certain

01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,440
types of metabolic syndrome, maybe even  orthogonal to the way that they age?

01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,560
Do I want to go in and change the way a neuron  is functioning to a different state to treat a

01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,520
particular type of neurodegenerative disease? These are all questions you can ask.

01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,480
They're not the ones we're going after, but  that is the more general, broader vision.

01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:23,920
This is so similar to, in LLMs, you first have  imitation learning with pre-training that builds

01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:31,440
a general-purpose representation of the world. Then you do RL about a particular objective in

01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,400
math or coding or whatever that you care about. You are describing an extremely similar

01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:43,360
procedure where first you just learn  to predict perturbations in genes to

01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,600
broad effects on the cell. That's the pre-training,

01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:52,160
just learning how cells work. Then there's another afterward

01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:58,640
layer of these value judgments of, "How would  we have to perturb it to have effect X?"

01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,440
That actually seems very similar to "How  do we get the base model to answer this

01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,160
math problem or answer this coding problem?" I don't know if people usually put it this way,

01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:13,120
but it actually just seems extremely similar. That makes me more optimistic on this. LLMs

01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,320
work and RL works. Yeah, they do. I

01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,400
think the conceptual analogy is very apt. We don't actually use RL at the moment,

01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,800
so I don't want to overstate the  level of sophistication we've got.

01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,840
But I think the general problem  reduces down in a similar way.

01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,960
You can think about your earlier  question of what does the general

01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,520
model look like that enables you to actually  have compounding returns in drug discovery.

01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,960
You might have something like this base model,  which as you said, just predicts this object

01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,880
function of, "How are these perturbations  hitting these targets going to change which

01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,800
genes are turned on and off in this cell?" Then there's an entirely other task, which is,

01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,040
well, which genes do you want to turn on and off? What state do I want the cell to adopt?

01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:54,080
Our lens on that is that across many  different diseases people have, age is

01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,240
one of the strongest predictors of how they're  going to progress, whether that disease arises.

01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,320
In many, many circumstances you have  evidence in humans where you can say,

01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,520
"Ah, if I could make the cell younger, maybe  that's not a perfect fix, but that's going to

01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,920
dramatically benefit not only patients who have a  diagnosed disease, but it might actually help most

01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:15,440
of us stay healthier longer, even subclinically  before anyone would formally say that we're sick."

01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,120
Now that's another more general function. The same way that in LLMs, you might have

01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:24,000
to create these particular RLHF environments,  you need to have places where you can state a

01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,240
value function of the particular task  that you're trying to optimize for.

01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,200
In drug discovery, you would then need  to know, "Well, what are the cell states

01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,880
I want to engineer for?" That's kind of the next

01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,560
generation of what a target might be. Beyond just which genes do I want to move

01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,840
up and down, and which gene perturbations  do I put in, you then need to know what

01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,680
cell state am I engineering for? What do I want this T cell to do?

01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,880
You’ll have a bunch of labelers in Nigeria  clicking different pictures of cells.

01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,120
Like, "Oh, this one looks  young. This one looks old."

01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:51,200
"This one looks really great. I love that  one." Potentially. Potentially. It's more

01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,120
like developmental biologists locked in a  room, as my friend Cole Trapnell would say.

01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,200
It seems like what you're describing  seems quite similar to Perturb-seq.

01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:04,000
I don't know when it was done, what year was it? There were three papers almost

01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,680
simultaneously in 2016. Okay, so almost a decade.

01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,000
We're still waiting, I guess, for the  big breakthroughs it's supposed to cause.

01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:17,680
This is the same procedure, so why  is this going to have an effect?

01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,600
Why has this taken so long? Good  question. The original procedure

01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,880
was created by a bunch of brilliant folks. There was a group in Ido Amit's lab at the

01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,120
Weizmann Institute, Aviv Regev's lab at the Broad,  where Atray Dixit, a friend of mine, helped work

01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:33,360
on this, and then Jonathan Weissman's lab at UCSF,  where Britt Adamson did a lot of the early work.

01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:37,760
They all constructed this idea  where you can go in and you label a

01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,360
perturbation that you're delivering to a cell. This is typically a transgenic perturbation,

01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,640
meaning you're integrating some  new gene into the genome of a cell.

01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,760
That turns another gene on or off. They used CRISPR, but there's lots of

01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,560
ways to do it and the concept's pretty general. Then you attach on that new transgene, that new

01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,640
gene you put into the genome of the cell, some  barcode that you can read out by DNA sequencing.

01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,480
Now when you rip the cells open, you're able  to not only measure every gene they're using,

01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,160
but you also sequence these barcodes, and you  know which genes you turned on and which are off.

01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,960
You can then start to ask questions like,  "Well, I've turned on genes A, B, and C,

01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,800
what did it do to the rest of the cell?" That's the general premise of the technology.

01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,800
It's useful to just set that up because it  explains why this didn't all happen earlier.

01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,000
The actual readout, ripping the cells open  and sequencing them, used to be pretty bad

01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,360
and it used to be really expensive. It's gotten much better over time.

01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,800
The metric people often think about  here is like cost per cell to sequence.

01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,760
It used to be measured in dollars  and now it's measured in cents,

01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:33,200
and down to the fractions of cents, because  that cost curve has improved dramatically.

01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:37,200
The cost of sequencing has likewise come down. So even beyond the actual reagents necessary to

01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,800
rip the cell open and turn its mRNAs into  DNAs that are ready for the sequencer,

01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,600
now the sequencer is cheaper. The other piece is, actually getting

01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,000
these genes in and then figuring out which  ones are there, it started out pretty bad.

01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,800
When we started with this technology,  it was a beautiful proof of concept,

01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,320
but I don't think anyone would tell  you it was 100% ready for prime time.

01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,440
When you sequenced a cell, only  about 50% of the time could you

01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,280
even tell which perturbation you put in. Sometimes you just wouldn't detect the barcode

01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,960
and you'd have to throw the cell away. Or you detect the wrong barcode and

01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,960
now you've mislabeled your data point. This might sound like a trivial sort of

01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,840
technical piece, but imagine you're running  this experiment the old-fashioned way.

01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,960
You test different groups of genes  in different test tubes on a bench.

01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,720
Now imagine you hired someone who  every other tube labels it wrong.

01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,080
When you then collect data from your experiment,  you basically have no idea what happened,

01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,200
because you've just randomized all  your data labels. You wouldn't do much

01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,120
science. You wouldn't get very far that way. A lot of those technologies have improved to

01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:33,280
the point where you had a number of processes  which are pretty inefficient and you multiplied

01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,040
a lot of these things together and ended  up with a very small outcome of successful

01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,520
cells you could actually sequence. They've all improved to the degree

01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,080
where now you can actually operate at scale. Groups like ours have had to do a bunch of

01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,320
work in order to actually enable combinatorial  perturbations, turning on more than just one gene

01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,560
at a time, which it turns out is much, much harder  for the same reason we were just alluding to.

01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,600
Imagine you're having trouble figuring  out which one gene you put in this cell

01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,600
and turned on or off. Now imagine you have to

01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,000
do that five times correctly in a row. Well, if you start out with the original

01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,640
performance where you could detect roughly 50%  of them, then the fraction of cells that would

01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,440
be correctly labeled is like 1/2^n, where n is  the number of genes you're trying to detect.

01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,560
Very quickly more of your data  is mislabeled than is labeled.

01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,400
There's lots of technical reasons like  this that have gotten worked out over time.

01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:22,880
Only now are we really able to scale up where  we're able to run experiments that are in the

01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,920
millions of cells in just a single day at,  for instance, a small company like NewLimit.

01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,240
There was a point even just six or seven  years ago where the companies that made

01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,920
these reagents were publishing the very  first million-cell data set just as a

01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,440
proof of concept and only they could do  it as the constructors of the technology.

01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,960
Now two scientists in our labs  can generate that in an afternoon.

01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:52,080
If it actually is the case that this is  very similar to the way LLM dynamics work,

01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:58,800
then once this technology is mature and you  get the GPT-3 equivalent of the virtual cell,

01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,600
what you would expect to happen is you get  many different companies, at least a couple,

01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,960
that are doing these cheap, Perturb-seq-like  experiments and building their own virtual cells.

01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:17,120
Then they're leasing this out to other people  who then have their own ideas about, "We want

01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:24,000
to see if we can come up with the labels for this  particular thing we care about and test for that."

01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
What it seems like is happening right now  is, at least at NewLimit, you are like,

01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,200
"We know the end use case we're going after." It would be as if Cursor in 2018 was like, "We're

01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:40,320
going to build our own LLM from scratch so that  we can enable our application," rather than some

01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,360
foundation model company being like, "We don't  care what you use it for, we're going to build

01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:49,440
this." Does that make sense? It seems like you're  combining two different layers of the stack.

01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:55,200
Because nobody else is doing the other  layer, you're just doing both of them.

01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,240
I don't know to what extent this analogy maps on. To play with the analogy a bit, imagine that

01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:04,400
you think about NewLimit as an LLM company. If I'm going to put us in the shoes of Cursor,

01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:09,520
which oh I so wish, imagine we're  trying to, in 2018, create Cursor Tab,

01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:14,000
but we're not trying to create a full LLM. I don't know enough about the underlying

01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,680
mechanics to know if that would have been  feasible, but it's a much more feasible problem

01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:22,880
than trying to create the most recent Cursor agent  or compete with modern Claude Code. That's roughly

01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:29,680
the equivalent. The problem we're breaking off is  a subset of the more general virtual cell problem.

01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,560
We're trying to predict, "What do  groups of transcription factors do

01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,440
to the age of very specific types of cells?" We only work on a few cell types at NewLimit

01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,000
because those are some of the only cell types  today with which we believe we can get really

01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,200
effective delivery of medicines. We think they're just more

01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,560
important because we can act on them today. If we solve the problem of what TFs to use,

01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,240
we can make a medicine pretty quickly. In a way, we're carving out a region of

01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:56,880
this massive parameter space and saying, "If we  can learn the distribution of effects even just

01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,040
in this small region, it's going to be really  effective for us, and we can make really amazing

01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:06,080
products, unlike the world has ever seen." Over time, we can expand to the corpus

01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:10,480
of predicting every possible gene  perturbation in every possible cell type.

01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,280
I think that's maybe the way the  analogy maps on, but it is true that

01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,240
we are vertically integrating here. We're generating our own data in a

01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,480
way that's proprietary. We think we have a much,

01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,320
much larger data set for this particular  regime than the rest of the world combined.

01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,600
That enables us to build what  we think are the best models.

01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,640
In many cases, what we found is that unlike  with LLMs, where a lot of the data that was

01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:35,920
necessary to build these was a common good—it was  produced as a function of the internet and shared

01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,160
across everyone, it's pretty common across all  the domains everyone wants to use it for—this

01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:46,080
biological data is still in its infancy. Imagine we're in the early 1980s and we

01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:51,680
are just now thinking about trying to create some  of the first web pages. That's the era we're in.

01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,000
We're going after and generating some of our own  data in this very niche circumstance, building

01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,160
the very high-quality corpus, the Wikipedia that  you might train your overly analogized- LLM on,

01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:06,080
and then building the first products based  on that and then expanding from there.

01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,400
We think that's necessary  because of where we are today.

01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,960
There isn't this Internet-like equivalent of data  that everyone can go out and reap rewards from.

01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:19,280
Interesting. This is more a question about the  broader pharma industry rather than just NewLimit.

01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:28,000
In the future, how are people going to make money? With the GLPs, we've got peptides from China that

01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,880
are just a gray market that  people can easily consume.

01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:36,240
Presumably, with these future AI models,  even if you have a patent on a molecule,

01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:41,040
finding an isomorphic molecule or an  isomorphic treatment is relatively easy.

01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,160
If you do come up with these crazy treatments and  if pharma in general is able to come up with these

01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,640
crazy treatments, will they be able to make money? The gray market piece, I'll put aside and say

01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:56,480
that’s IP enforcement at a geostrategic  level that I'm not qualified to speak to.

01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:04,320
It comes down to IP enforcement effectively. For that gray market piece, another reason that

01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,640
the traditional pharmaceutical industry will still  continue to reap the majority of rewards here is

01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:14,000
that most of the payment in the United States,  which provides most of the revenue for drug

01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,320
discovery in the world, goes through a payment  system that is not just direct-to-consumer. It

01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:24,480
goes through payers. If you have the opportunity  to either order a sketchy vial off of some website

01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:29,520
from some company in Shenzhen, or you can go  through your doctor and get a prescription

01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:35,440
with a relatively low co-pay for Tirzepatide, the  real thing, most patients will go for Tirzepatide.

01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,360
You and I probably live in a milieu of people who  are much more comfortable with ordering the vials

01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,920
from Shenzhen than most people might be. I don't consider that to be a tremendous

01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,040
concern writ large. The broader point is,

01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:52,000
if you have medicines with very long-term  durability, how do you reimburse them?

01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:58,160
If the benefits are very long term and accrue  in the out-years… A challenge we have in

01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:02,480
the US system is that the average person  churns insurers every three to four years.

01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,440
That number fluctuates around, but  that's the right order of magnitude.

01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,280
That means that if you had a medicine  which dramatically reduced the cost

01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,960
of all other healthcare incidents, but it  happened exactly five years after you got

01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,360
dosed with it, no insurer is technically  economically incentivized to cover that.

01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,960
I think there are a couple of  models here that can make sense.

01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:26,480
One is something called pay-for-performance where,  rather than reimbursing all of the cost of the

01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:31,760
drug upfront, you reimburse it over time. Say you get a medicine that just makes you

01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:36,000
generically healthier and you can measure the  reduced rates of heart attack and reduced rates

01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,160
of obesity and various other things, and you  get this one dose and it lasts for 10 years.

01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:44,000
Each year you would pay something like a tenth  of the cost of the medicine contingent on the

01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,680
idea that it was actually still working for  you and you had some way of measuring that.

01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,760
That's a big challenge in this industry. How would you demonstrate that any one of

01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,760
these medicines is still working for the patient? In the few examples we have today, these are

01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,280
things like gene therapies where you can just  measure the expression of the gene and it’s like,

01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,400
"Okay, the drug is still there." It gets more complicated when you

01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:06,800
have some of these longer-term net benefits. The idea would be that then each insurer is

01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,640
incentivized to just pay for the time  of coverage that you're on their plan.

01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,440
We already have a framework for this  post-Affordable Care Act in the US where

01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,920
pre-existing conditions no longer really exist. Patients are able to freely move between payers,

01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:23,840
and you could sort of treat the presence  of one of these therapeutics lowering

01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,080
this patient's overall healthcare costs the  same way we treat a pre-existing condition.

01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,520
This is something that the system  is still overall figuring out.

01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,720
What I'm saying here is one hypothesis  about what the future might look like,

01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:39,120
but there are alternative clever approaches  people might think about for reimbursement.

01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:43,040
I think over time we're going to move  more toward a direct-to-consumer model

01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:47,680
for many of these medicines which preserve and  promote health rather than just fixing disease.

01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,120
You're seeing what are really some of the  most innovative examples of this right now

01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,280
from Lilly around the incretin mimetics,  where they actually launched LillyDirect.

01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,720
For the first time, rather than going to  a pharmacy, which interacts with a PBM,

01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,400
which interacts with your primary care physician…  You can get a prescription from your doctor,

01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,160
go straight to Lilly, the source of the good  stuff, and you're able to order high-quality

01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:10,320
drugs from them, and not involve some  intermediary compounder in the middle that

01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:16,400
might not even make your molecules properly. As these medicines develop that have actual

01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,560
consumer demand—because you feel it in your daily  life and you're actually seeing a benefit from it,

01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,520
it's not just something that your  physician is trying to get you to

01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,480
take—that model will start to dominate. That means that this payment over time for

01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:33,360
some of these long-term benefits might be able  to be abstracted away from our current payer

01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:38,720
system where it churns every few years. A payment-over-time plan, the same way we

01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,200
finance other large purchases  in life, seems very feasible.

01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:46,800
The reason I'm interested in this is  that healthcare is already 20% of GDP.

01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,280
It's grown notable percentages  in the last few years.

01:36:52,080 --> 01:37:02,400
This is a fraction that is quickly growing. The overwhelming majority of this is going

01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,560
towards administering treatments  that have already been invented.

01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:13,600
That’s good, but nowhere near as good as  spending this enormous sum of resources

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,760
towards coming up with new treatments that  in the future will improve the lives of

01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:23,360
people that will have these ailments. One question is just how do we make it

01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:28,080
so that more… If we're going to spend 20%  of GDP on healthcare, it should at least go

01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:32,080
towards coming up with new treatments rather  than just paying nurses and doctors to keep

01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:40,320
administering stuff that kind of works now. Two, if the cost of drugs, at least from the

01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,880
perspective of the payer, ends up being,  you need a doctor to give you some scan

01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:51,040
before he can write you a prescription and  then they need to administer it and they

01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:58,400
need to make sure that you're doing okay,  etc… Even if for you to manufacture this

01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:05,520
therapy it might cost tens of dollars per patient,  for the healthcare system overall, it might be

01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,800
tens of thousands of dollars per patient. I'm curious if you agree with those

01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,960
orders of magnitude. I think that's correct. I

01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,240
think the stat is something like drugs  are roughly 7% of healthcare spend.

01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,640
I could be a little bit wrong  on that, but the OOM is right.

01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,480
Basically, even if we invent de-aging technology,  or especially if we invent de-aging technology,

01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,040
how should we think about the way  it will net out in the fraction

01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,680
of GDP that we have to spend on healthcare? Will that increase because everybody's lining

01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,560
up at the doctor's office to get a prescription  and you gotta go into the clinic every week?

01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:38,960
Or will that decrease because the other downstream  ailments from aging aren't coming about?

01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,640
I think the latter is much more  likely to be the case. Here are some

01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:47,600
quick heuristics. There are many reasons  that healthcare costs so much in the US.

01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,680
One of them is something like Baumol's  cost disease, which is very unrelated to

01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:55,520
pharmaceutical discoveries but is something  that we will have to solve in the system.

01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:00,000
Part of it's the disintermediation of the  actual customer and the actual provider.

01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,960
These are things that biotech probably isn't  going to be able to solve as an industry alone.

01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:10,480
That's probably a larger economic problem. But when you think about how this will affect

01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,720
the total amount of healthcare  that will need to be delivered.

01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,240
If you have more of these medicines for everyone,  medicines that keep you healthier longer rather

01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:23,280
than medicines that only fix a problem once you're  already very sick, I think you actually avoid

01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,600
a lot of the types of administration costs. It’s not just administration like admins at

01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,720
hospitals, but the cost of administering existing  medicines and therapies to you. That’s going down.

01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,560
One stat on why I think that's true. Something like a third of all Medicare costs are

01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,080
spent in the final year of life, which is shocking  when you realize that the average person on

01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:47,360
Medicare is probably a decade-plus covered by it. There's an incredible concentration of the actual

01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:53,520
expenses once someone is already terribly sick. Helping prevent you from ever having to access

01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,840
the intensive healthcare system, something like  an inpatient hospital visit, if you can prevent

01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,720
even just a couple of those visits over a long  period of someone's life with a medicine like

01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:06,880
an incretin mimetic, like a reprogramming medicine  that keeps your liver, your immune system younger,

01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,840
on net that actually starts to drive healthcare  spend down because you're shifting some of

01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,120
that burden from the administration  system to the pharmaceutical system.

01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,440
The pharmaceutical system is  the only piece of healthcare

01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,800
where technology has made us more efficient. As drugs go generic, the cost of administering

01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,200
a given unit of healthcare is going down. The grand social contract is

01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:30,720
that they eventually go generic. That's the way our current IP system works.

01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:35,200
So if you were to get the question of, "When would  you like to be born as a patient?" you always want

01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,880
to be born as close to today as possible. Because for a given unit in terms of

01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:43,760
pharmaceuticals, for a given dollar unit of  expense, you can access more pharmaceutical

01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,000
technology today than has ever been possible  in history, even as healthcare costs

01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,840
everywhere else in the system have shot up. Pharmaceuticals are the one place where,

01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,840
because of the mechanism of things going  generic and the fact that our old medicines

01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:01,120
continue to work and persist over time,  you're able to get more benefit per dollar.

01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:08,720
Okay, final question. Pharma is spending billions  of dollars per new drug it comes up with.

01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:12,320
Surely they have noticed that the lack  of some general platform or some general

01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,400
model has made it more and more expensive  and difficult to come up with new drugs.

01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:21,600
You say Perturb-seq has existed since 2016. As far as you can tell, you have the most

01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,560
amount of that kind of data which would  feed into a general-purpose model.

01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:33,040
What is the traditional pharma  industry on the other coast up to?

01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,280
If I went to the head of R&D at  Eli Lilly or Pfizer or something,

01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:42,080
do they think that this is like they have some  different idea of the platform that needs to

01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:46,560
be built or they're like, "No, we're all in  on the bespoke game, bespoke for each drug?"

01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,600
I'll just correct one thing to  make sure I'm not overstating.

01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,920
We have way more data for the limited  subproblem we're tackling, which is

01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,600
overexpressing TFs in combinations. We have way more data than anyone,

01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,400
full stop, there. But even more specifically, I feel very,

01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,080
very confident we have more data than anyone  looking at trying to reprogram a cell's age.

01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,840
That's where we're way larger  than the rest of the world.

01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,320
When we think about just general single-cell  perturbation data of various flavors,

01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,760
there are other groups which have  very large data sets as well.

01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,320
We're still differentiated because we  do everything in human cells with the

01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:21,760
right number of chromosomes, whereas it's very  common to do things in cancer cell lines which

01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:27,200
have 200 chromosomes. Is that human? I don't know.  Depends on how you actually quantify these things.

01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,960
So then, if you’re going to go ask the leaders  of some of the traditional pharmaceutical firms,

01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,920
"Are you trying to build a general model?" I think some of them have in-house AI

01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,880
innovation teams that are working on this. There are really smart people there.

01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,240
But as a general trend, you  can think about some of the

01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:49,520
modern pharmas a bit like venture capital firms. They've over time externalized a lot of their R&D.

01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,960
They often have divisions of external  innovation, which you can think of as

01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,600
the corp dev version of venture capital. They work with the biotech ecosystem to

01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:04,240
have a number of smaller, nimble firms explore  really pioneer ideas, the types of things we're

01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:08,800
working on, and then eventually partner with them  once they have assets that are later downstream.

01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:14,080
The industry has sort of bifurcated  where smaller biotechs like ours

01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:17,120
take on most of the early discovery. I'm going to get it a little bit wrong

01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,880
from memory, but it's something like 70% of  molecules approved in a given year come from

01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,880
originally small biotechs rather than large  pharmas, even though you look at the actual

01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,800
dollars of R&D spend on the balance  sheet and it's largely in big pharma.

01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:34,560
Another level of disintermediation. Part of the reason for that difference in

01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,920
cost is they're running most of the trials. Most people partner with pharma to run

01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,520
trials where a lot of the costs are incurred. It's not just that all large pharmas are horribly

01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,680
inefficient or anything like that. Some of them would tell you,

01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:49,200
"These ideas are really exciting. We have an external innovation department, if we

01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:53,520
don't have one internally, or we're collaborating  with a startup that's doing something similar."

01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:58,000
You can think of the market structure like you  have a bunch of biotechs, which are the startups

01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,640
in your ecosystem, and then they're working  with something like an oligopsony of pharmas.

01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:06,400
It's a limited number of buyers for  this particular type of product,

01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,640
which is a therapeutic asset that is  ready for a phase one, phase two trial.

01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,840
There's a very liquid market for the phase  one, phase two assets, and that's the point at

01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:18,000
which these partnerships can come to fruition. That's what a lot of those leaders would say.

01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:22,160
By contrast, for instance, Roche  bought Genentech back in 2013.

01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,160
R&D is currently run by Aviv Regev, one of  the scientists I admire most in the world,

01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:30,720
who's like a thousand times smarter than me. She's one of the people who invented this

01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,600
technology and has a big group  doing this sort of work there.

01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,880
So it's not like every pharma takes  that view, but that's a general trend.

01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:42,640
Full disclosure, I am a small  angel investor in NewLimit now,

01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:47,280
but that did not influence the decision to have  Jacob on. This is super fascinating. Thanks so

01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:53,760
much for coming on the podcast. Awesome. Thanks, Dwarkesh.
