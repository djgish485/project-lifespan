# Evidence Framework

We register studies with metadata: species, intervention, endpoints (median/maximum lifespan, hazard ratios, healthspan), controls, design (blinding, randomization), replication, effect size, and quality flags.

Data live in `data/evidence.csv` and are cited via `references/references.bib` or `references/links.yaml` for web.

Quality flags:

- Preclinical vs clinical
- Pre-registration
- Replication status
- Sample size and power
- Blinding/randomization
