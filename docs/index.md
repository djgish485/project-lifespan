# Overview

Map the scientific landscape of human aging through a Popperian lens: sharp claims, risky predictions, severe tests, rival explanations, and traceable primary sources.

We focus on:

- Explaining major theories of aging for laypeople and practitioners.
- Making predictions explicit and separating core claims from auxiliary assumptions.
- Tracking evidence and disconfirmations with citations to primary sources.
- Proposing simple, cheap, fast experiments — often in mice — that can decisively discriminate between rivals.

Explore the theories below and browse proposed experiments. A lightweight comparison rubric is being piloted; scoring and weights will evolve as evidence accumulates. Contribute improvements as we refine the map.
