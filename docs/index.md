# Overview

Understand the scientific landscape of human aging through a Popperian lens: clear claims, risky predictions, decisive tests, competing theories, and traceable evidence.

We aim to:

- Explain major theories of aging for laypeople and practitioners.
- Separate core claims from auxiliary assumptions and quantify predictions.
- Track evidence and disconfirmations with citations to primary sources.
- Propose simple, cheap, fast experiments — especially in mice — to falsify or corroborate claims.

Explore the theories, compare Popper Scores, and browse proposed experiments. Contribute improvements as we refine the map.
