# Compare Theories

High-level comparison of Popper Scores and key predictions. Scores are page-local and computed from front matter; weights configurable in `mkdocs.yml`.

Use this page to summarize deltas and point to most decisive next tests.

Decisive next tests (sketch):

- Sinclair: Pre-registered OSK lifespan study in aged WT mice with tumor monitoring and blinded hazard analysis.
- SENS: Multi-class repair stack vs best single agent on maximum lifespan; toxicity profile and synergy.
- Fedichev: Interventions that measurably reduce resilience autocorrelation time and lower mortality hazard.
- Levin: Bioelectric modulation improving regeneration in aged mammalian tissues without oncogenic risk.

Context:

- Rivals and complements include hyperfunction/mTOR [@Blagosklonny2022] and Hallmarks frameworks [@LopezOtin2013; @LopezOtin2023].

## Pairwise Discriminators (sketch)

- Pathogen Control (Lidsky) vs Classic Models (damage accumulation / antagonistic pleiotropy / disposable soma)
  - Decisive test: Document stress-induced rejuvenation across taxa vs predicted impossibility under classics; in mammals, under chronic infection, rejuvenation/extension should show infection tradeoffs unless pathogen control co-improves.

- Pathogen Control vs SENS (damage-repair)
  - Decisive test: In aged, infected mice, stacked repairs that extend lifespan should increase infection persistence/transmission proxies unless paired with anti-pathogen measures.

- Pathogen Control vs Sinclair (epigenetic reset)
  - Decisive test: Under pathogen challenge, partial reprogramming regimens extending healthspan/lifespan should incur measurable infection penalties unless combined with pathogen control.

- Pathogen Control vs Fedichev (resilience/criticality)
  - Decisive test: Reducing pathogen burden reduces autocorrelation time/variance and hazard beyond non-infection interventions.

- Pathogen Control vs Levin (bioelectric regeneration)
  - Decisive test: Regeneration/rejuvenation protocols evaluated under pathogen challenge for tradeoffs predicted by PC vs none predicted by purely intrinsic control frameworks.

- SENS (damage-repair) vs Sinclair (epigenetic reset)
  - Decisive test: Head-to-head across pre-registered mouse studies: stacked repairs vs OSK. If OSK alone yields robust max-lifespan gains with acceptable safety, that favors Sinclair; if stacked repairs outperform OSK or OSK improves biomarkers without lifespan gains, that favors SENS.

- Resilience/Criticality vs Sinclair
  - Decisive test: Compare hazard reductions from resilience interventions vs OSK under similar conditions. Comparable or better hazard shifts from resilience training without reprogramming favor Resilience; large OSK-specific gains favor Sinclair.

- SENS vs Bioelectric
  - Decisive test: In aged mammals, test whether pattern control alone (bioelectric modulation) yields strong functional rejuvenation; if adding repairs unlocks/boosts effects, that favors SENS; strong pattern-only gains favor Bioelectric primacy.

- Longevity Bottleneck vs SENS
  - Decisive test: Targeted relief of a chronic damage-response pathway vs multi-class repairs. If a single bottleneck fix rivals stacked repairs with fewer side effects, that favors Bottleneck.

- Longevity Bottleneck vs Sinclair
  - Decisive test: Pathway-precision relief vs global epigenetic reset; which yields better hazard/frailty improvements with lower risk in aged mice.

- Classics vs each 
  - Decisive test: For any large lifespan gain, document tradeoffs (tumors, infection penalties, fitness costs). Large, low-cost gains challenge Classic Models.
