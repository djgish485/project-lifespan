# Popperian Rubric

We score each theory on nine criteria (0–5 each), configurable via weights in `mkdocs.yml`.

- Falsifiability — Can the core claim be tested and potentially refuted?
- Riskiness — Are the predictions severe (hard to pass by luck or vagueness)?
- Precision — Are predictions operationalized with clear endpoints and timelines?
- Empirical Content — How much of the world the theory constrains; detail of testable claims.
- Novel Predictions — Does it predict new phenomena or results not used to fit the theory?
- Survived Severe Tests — Has it passed stringent, pre-registered or otherwise probative tests?
- Exposure to Refutation — Has it been widely tested across conditions and rivals?
- Rival Comparison — Does it outperform rival explanations on the same evidence?
- Consilience — Does it coherently explain diverse findings without ad hoc fixes?

Scores are rendered per page from front matter using a lightweight macro. We prioritize explicit disconfirmations and null results.
