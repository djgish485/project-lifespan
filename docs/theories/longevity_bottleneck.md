## Lay Summary

Suggests the body’s response to damage becomes stuck “on”, causing collateral harm and degeneration. If we remove the bottleneck, the system might restore youthful repair.

## Technical Summary

- Hypothesis: chronic activation of tissue damage response pathways drives systemic aging; targeted resolution normalizes signaling and repair. Related to concepts of inflammaging (chronic, low-grade inflammation increasing with age) [@Franceschi2018].

## Core Claims

- {{ claim('lb-c1', 'Specific damage-response pathways become chronically activated and are causal for aging phenotypes.', 'Disabling the overactivation restores function and extends lifespan.') }}

## Predictions

- Pre-registered, targeted modulation in mice lowers inflammatory tone, improves resilience, and extends maximum lifespan.

## Evidence

- To collect.

## Rivals

- General inflammaging models; hyperfunction vs damage-first; compare predictions.

## Critiques

### Outbound (Longevity Bottleneck → others)

#### [Classic Models (Damage/AP/Disposable Soma)](classic_models.md)

- If a specific damage‑response pathway stuck “on” drives aging, resolving that bottleneck could produce large gains without broad increases in repair budgets, challenging a diffuse damage/tradeoff explanation.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Resolve Damage‑Response Bottleneck</a> — Target chronic activation and check for hazard/frailty improvements beyond a non‑specific longevity control. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
  </ul>

#### [SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)](sens_damage_repair.md)

- SENS proposes many damage classes; Bottleneck suggests a small number of chronic‑activation chokepoints dominate. If relieving one key bottleneck outperforms multi‑repair stacks on hazard with fewer side effects, that favors Bottleneck.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Resolve Damage‑Response Bottleneck</a> — Test targeted pathway relief. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Compare magnitude/durability vs targeted relief. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: Bottleneck/Inflammaging primary above; SENS primary

#### [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](pathogen_control.md)

- Bottleneck frames chronic activation as intrinsic; PC predicts infection ecology drives it. If anti‑pathogen measures don’t calm the pathway but targeted relief does, that favors Bottleneck over PC.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Anti‑Pathogen vs Targeted Relief</a> — Compare anti‑infection protocol against pathway relief on signaling and hazard. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)](epigenetic_information.md)

- If chronic damage‑response activation is the core driver, normalizing those pathways may deliver benefits similar to or better than reprogramming, with lower tumor risk.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Resolve Damage‑Response Bottleneck</a> — Pathway‑level normalization. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — System‑wide state reset for comparison. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: Bottleneck primary; Sinclair primary
### Inbound (from Pathogen Control (Lidsky))

- Persistent infections may keep damage‑response pathways stuck “on”; reducing pathogen burden should calm signaling.
  - Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Anti‑Pathogen Interventions to Resolve Damage‑Response Bottlenecks</a> — Help older mice clear hidden infections. If inflammation/damage signals calm down and survival improves more than a standard longevity control, it supports Pathogen Control; if not, the bottleneck likely isn’t infection‑driven. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
    </ul>

### Inbound (from Classic Models)

- Chronic activation might reflect cumulative damage and tradeoffs, not a discrete bottleneck.
- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Resolve Damage‑Response Bottleneck</a> — If targeted relief has small effects, that supports Classics. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: Foundational classics

### Inbound (from SENS (Damage Repair))

- Multiple damage classes may need repair; a single bottleneck fix may be insufficient.
- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Compare to targeted pathway relief. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: SENS primary

### Inbound (from Sinclair (Epigenetic Information))

- Epigenetic mis‑specification may drive chronic activation; reprogramming could normalize it without pathway‑specific interventions.
- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — Check whether OSK calms damage‑response markers along with lifespan gains. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
  </ul>

## Proposed Experiments

- {{ experiment_box('Resolve damage-response bottleneck in aged mice', 'Chronic activation is causal.', 'Intervention extends max lifespan and improves frailty index.', 'Max lifespan, frailty, cytokine panel.', 'Vehicle, isotype controls, rapamycin benchmark.', '$300k–$700k', '12–24 months') }}
