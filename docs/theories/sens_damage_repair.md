## Lay Summary

SENS treats aging as fixable damage types (e.g., senescent cells, extracellular junk, mitochondrial mutations). If you regularly repair each, you can keep the organism youthful regardless of upstream causes.

## Technical Summary

- Enumerate damage classes and proposed interventions (e.g., senescent cells and senolytics; extracellular/crosslink junk and breakers; intracellular aggregates; mitochondrial mutations and allotopic expression; loss of stem cells; cancerous cells; extracellular matrix stiffening).

## Core Claims

- {{ claim('sens-c1', 'A manageable set of damage classes suffices to prevent age-related functional decline.', 'Periodic repair of each class maintains youthful function and extends max lifespan.') }}

## Predictions

- Combined repair addressing multiple SENS classes in mice extends maximum lifespan beyond the best single interventions.

## Evidence

### For

- Senolytic benefits in mice: improved function and increased survival following D+Q treatment in old mice [@Xu2018]; genetic clearance of p16Ink4a+ cells delays age-associated disorders [@Baker2011].
- Telomerase gene therapy increases median lifespan in adult and old mice without increased cancer [@deJesus2012].

### Against / Disconfirmations

- Limited demonstrations of combined, comprehensive repair; long-term safety unknown.

## Rivals

- Epigenetic reset-first, hyperfunction/mTOR, mitochondrial centrality; compare predictions on maximum vs median lifespan.

## Critiques

### Inbound (from Pathogen Control (Lidsky))

- Big lifespan gains from repair could let infections linger unless anti‑infection measures co‑apply.
  - Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_infection_tradeoff.md">Stacked Damage‑Repair Under Chronic Infection</a> — Give older, infected mice multiple repairs; half also get anti‑infection. If repairs alone cleanly help, that supports SENS; if the combo is required to avoid infection costs, that supports Pathogen Control. (18–30 months; $700k–$1.5M)</li>
    </ul>

### Inbound (from Sinclair (Epigenetic Information))

- Resetting epigenetic information could obviate the need to enumerate/repair all damage classes.
- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — If OSK alone delivers strong max‑lifespan gains with safety, that challenges SENS primacy. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>

### Inbound (from Classic Models)

- Major repair stacks should reveal tradeoffs/toxicity or limited returns; large safe gains would challenge strict tradeoff constraints.

### Inbound (from Resilience/Criticality)

- System‑level dynamics can reduce hazard; repairing specific damages may be neither necessary nor sufficient if dynamics dominate.
- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>

### Inbound (from Bioelectric / Morphogenetic)

- Pattern control might enable regeneration without addressing all damage classes; repairs could be secondary.
- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/vmem_regeneration.md">Bioelectric Modulation</a> — If pattern reset alone yields strong gains, that weighs against repair primacy. (3–6 months; $100k–$200k)</li>

### Outbound (SENS → others)

#### [Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)](epigenetic_information.md)

- SENS argues that defined classes of damage drive aging; repairing them should extend maximum lifespan, whereas biomarker resets without addressing damage may not. If OSK improves biomarkers but fails to deliver robust max‑lifespan gains, that supports SENS.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Multiple repairs in aged mice; test for >15% max‑lifespan extension with acceptable safety. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — If OSK yields biomarker reversal but limited lifespan gains vs stacked repairs, that favors SENS. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: <a href="https://vxtwitter.com/jpsenescence/status/1962604483357106366">Telomere thread (mirror)</a>; primary <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-018-0092-9">Xu2018</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature10600">Baker2011</a>

#### [Classic Models (Damage/AP/Disposable Soma)](classic_models.md)

- SENS is compatible with non‑programmed origins but predicts practical, engineered escapes from tradeoff limits via targeted repairs. Large, safe max‑lifespan gains with limited fitness costs would challenge strict budget/pleiotropy constraints.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — If combined repairs extend max lifespan strongly without major tradeoffs, that challenges Classic Models’ constraints. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](pathogen_control.md)

- SENS predicts that repairing damage should help even under pathogen pressure, without needing anti‑infection measures. If repairs alone extend lifespan and do not worsen infection metrics, that weighs against PC.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_infection_tradeoff.md">Repairs Under Chronic Infection</a> — Stacked repairs ± anti‑pathogen support in aged, infected mice; look for infection penalties or need for combo. (18–30 months; $700k–$1.5M)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: <a href="https://vxtwitter.com/lidskypeter/status/1962526281863508444">PC tweet mirror</a>; SENS primary above

#### [Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)](resilience_criticality.md)

- If damage is causal, fixing it should shift the whole hazard curve; resilience‑only training that doesn’t address damage should show smaller or transient benefits.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Look for durable hazard reductions. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/resilience_training.md">Resilience Training</a> — Benchmark against non‑repair interventions for hazard and resilience metrics. (12–24 months; $150k–$300k)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23014-1">Resilience metrics (Pyrkov2021)</a>; SENS primary above

#### [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

- Pattern control may improve regeneration, but if underlying damage blocks repair, pattern‑only interventions won’t yield large, safe lifespan gains; SENS expects damage repair to unlock or amplify such effects.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/vmem_regeneration.md">Bioelectric Modulation</a> — Test in aged mice; if pattern control alone is limited, adding repairs should amplify benefits. (3–6 months; $100k–$200k)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.034">Levin2021</a>; SENS primary above
