# SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging is caused by a manageable set of damages; periodic, targeted repairs can maintain youthful function and extend lifespan.
- Not just biomarkers: decisive wins are durable max‑lifespan gains from combined repair stacks with acceptable safety; manage diminishing returns/toxicity.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)
    <ul>
      <li>Sinclair: Correcting epigenetic state can restore function without enumerating damage.</li>
      <li>SENS: Repaired damages are necessary and sufficient for large lifespan gains; biomarker resets may not translate without repairs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)
    <ul>
      <li>Classics: Repairs should show costs/limits; big gains are unlikely.</li>
      <li>SENS: Carefully targeted, stacked repairs can push max lifespan beyond best single agents with manageable toxicity, challenging strict budget constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pathogen Control (Lidsky)
    <ul>
      <li>PC: Under pathogen challenge, extensions should trade off with infection unless paired with anti‑pathogen measures.</li>
      <li>SENS: Repairs can extend lifespan without infection penalties; clean wins under challenge weigh against PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)
    <ul>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard can drop by tuning dynamics without repairs.</li>
      <li>SENS: Fixing concrete damages shifts the whole hazard curve; resilience‑only wins should be smaller/transient if damage is primary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern reset may obviate some repairs.</li>
      <li>SENS: If damage blocks pattern control, repairs are prerequisite; strong repair‑first wins favor SENS primacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: One/few pathways dominate; relieve the chokepoint.</li>
      <li>SENS: Multiple damages jointly matter; broad, combined repairs outperform single‑pathway relief.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

- SENS argues that defined classes of damage drive aging; repairing them should extend maximum lifespan, whereas biomarker resets without addressing damage may not. If OSK improves biomarkers but fails to deliver robust max‑lifespan gains, that supports SENS.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Multiple repairs in aged mice; test for >15% max‑lifespan extension with acceptable safety. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — If OSK yields biomarker reversal but limited lifespan gains vs stacked repairs, that favors SENS. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Classic Models (Damage/AP/Disposable Soma)](classic_models.md)

- SENS is compatible with non‑programmed origins but predicts practical, engineered escapes from tradeoff limits via targeted repairs. Large, safe max‑lifespan gains with limited fitness costs would challenge strict budget/pleiotropy constraints.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — If combined repairs extend max lifespan strongly without major tradeoffs, that challenges Classic Models’ constraints. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>

#### [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](pathogen_control.md)

- SENS predicts that repairing damage should help even under pathogen pressure, without needing anti‑infection measures. If repairs alone extend lifespan and do not worsen infection metrics, that weighs against PC.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_infection_tradeoff.md">Repairs Under Chronic Infection</a> — Stacked repairs ± anti‑pathogen support in aged, infected mice; look for infection penalties or need for combo. (18–30 months; $700k–$1.5M)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)](resilience_criticality.md)

- If damage is causal, fixing it should shift the whole hazard curve; resilience‑only training that doesn’t address damage should show smaller or transient benefits.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Look for durable hazard reductions. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/resilience_training.md">Resilience Training</a> — Benchmark against non‑repair interventions for hazard and resilience metrics. (12–24 months; $150k–$300k)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23014-1">Resilience metrics (Pyrkov2021)</a>; SENS primary above

#### [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

- Pattern control may improve regeneration, but if underlying damage blocks repair, pattern‑only interventions won’t yield large, safe lifespan gains; SENS expects damage repair to unlock or amplify such effects.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/vmem_regeneration.md">Bioelectric Modulation</a> — Test in aged mice; if pattern control alone is limited, adding repairs should amplify benefits. (3–6 months; $100k–$200k)</li>
