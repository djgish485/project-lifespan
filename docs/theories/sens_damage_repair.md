# SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging is caused by a manageable set of damages; periodic, targeted repairs can maintain youthful function and extend lifespan.
- Not just biomarkers: decisive wins are durable max‑lifespan gains from combined repair stacks with acceptable safety; manage diminishing returns/toxicity.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)
    <ul>
      <li>Sinclair: Correcting epigenetic state can restore function without enumerating damage.</li>
      <li>SENS: Repaired damages are necessary and sufficient for large lifespan gains; biomarker resets may not translate without repairs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)
    <ul>
      <li>Classics: Repairs should show costs/limits; big gains are unlikely.</li>
      <li>SENS: Carefully targeted, stacked repairs can push max lifespan beyond best single agents with manageable toxicity, challenging strict budget constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pathogen Control (Lidsky)
    <ul>
      <li>PC: Under pathogen challenge, extensions should trade off with infection unless paired with anti‑pathogen measures.</li>
      <li>SENS: Repairs can extend lifespan without infection penalties; clean wins under pathogen challenge weigh against PC.</li>
      <li>PC argues lifespan varies with population structure (dispersal, eusociality, cohorting), which repair‑first frameworks do not explain by default.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)
    <ul>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard can drop by tuning dynamics without repairs.</li>
      <li>SENS: Fixing concrete damages shifts the whole hazard curve; resilience‑only wins should be smaller/transient if damage is primary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern reset may obviate some repairs.</li>
      <li>SENS: If damage blocks pattern control, repairs are prerequisite; strong repair‑first wins favor SENS primacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: One/few pathways dominate; relieve the chokepoint.</li>
      <li>SENS: Multiple damages jointly matter; broad, combined repairs outperform single‑pathway relief.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Questions

### What is the status and relevance of LEV Foundation’s Robust Mouse Rejuvenation studies?

LEV Foundation’s RMR1 tested a SENS‑style combination in aged mice using factorial groups (single agents, “all‑but‑one,” and full stack) built from rapamycin, senescent‑cell ablation (galactose‑conjugated navitoclax), telomerase gene therapy (AAV‑mTERT, intranasal, monthly), and hematopoietic stem‑cell transplant with G‑CSF+AMD3100 mobilization. Design details and interim updates are public, but a full statistical analysis (median and maximum lifespan deltas, hazards, pathology) has not been posted yet. See overview and updates: https://www.levf.org/projects/robust-mouse-rejuvenation-study-1 and https://www.levf.org/projects/robust-mouse-rejuvenation-study-1/study-updates.

RMR2 shifts to a different stack aimed at systemic repair/modulation (recombinant serum albumin, mesenchymal stem cells, Cdc42 inhibition with CASIN, a lipid‑metabolism targeted senolysis concept, and oxytocin). From a SENS perspective, these programs are direct tests of stacked repairs: clear, durable increases in both mean and maximum lifespan with acceptable safety would be strong evidence for SENS primacy; modest or antagonistic effects would argue for re‑tuning stacks or adding other modalities. Until LEVF publishes the RMR1 analysis, we treat outcomes as pending and will update this page when formal results appear.
