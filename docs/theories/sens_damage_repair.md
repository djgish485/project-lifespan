# SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging is caused by a manageable set of damages; periodic, targeted repairs can maintain youthful function and extend lifespan.
- Not just biomarkers: decisive wins are durable max‑lifespan gains from combined repair stacks with acceptable safety; manage diminishing returns/toxicity.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)
    <ul>
      <li>Sinclair: Correcting epigenetic state can restore function without enumerating damage.</li>
      <li>SENS: Repaired damages are necessary and sufficient for large lifespan gains; biomarker resets may not translate without repairs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)
    <ul>
      <li>Classics: Repairs should show costs/limits; big gains are unlikely.</li>
      <li>SENS: Carefully targeted, stacked repairs can push max lifespan beyond best single agents with manageable toxicity, challenging strict budget constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pathogen Control (Lidsky)
    <ul>
      <li>PC: Under pathogen challenge, extensions should trade off with infection unless paired with anti‑pathogen measures.</li>
      <li>SENS: Repairs can extend lifespan without infection penalties; clean wins under challenge weigh against PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)
    <ul>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard can drop by tuning dynamics without repairs.</li>
      <li>SENS: Fixing concrete damages shifts the whole hazard curve; resilience‑only wins should be smaller/transient if damage is primary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern reset may obviate some repairs.</li>
      <li>SENS: If damage blocks pattern control, repairs are prerequisite; strong repair‑first wins favor SENS primacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: One/few pathways dominate; relieve the chokepoint.</li>
      <li>SENS: Multiple damages jointly matter; broad, combined repairs outperform single‑pathway relief.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
