  Pathogen Control Hypothesis: aging is an adaptive, programmed response shaped by infectious disease dynamics; limiting lifespan reduces pathogen persistence and spread. Cellular senescence functions as an antiviral “immune militia.”

# Pathogen Control (Lidsky)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging evolves to curb pathogen spread/persistence; finite lifespan limits epidemics. Senescent cells act as an antiviral “militia” when timed/cleared correctly.
- Infection tradeoffs: In high‑burden settings, big longevity gains should come with infection penalties unless anti‑pathogen measures co‑apply.
- Comparative/experimental signature: longevity wins without infection costs under pathogen challenge weigh against this view.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)
    <ul>
      <li>Sinclair: Partial reprogramming can rejuvenate without infection penalties.</li>
      <li>PC: under pathogen challenge, rejuvenation should incur infection costs unless anti‑pathogen control is added.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)
    <ul>
      <li>SENS: Repairs extend lifespan independent of infection ecology.</li>
      <li>PC: In high‑burden contexts, repairs alone risk increased pathogen persistence unless co‑applied with anti‑pathogen strategies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)
    <ul>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard falls by improving system dynamics even without infection changes.</li>
      <li>PC: Reducing pathogen burden is the primary driver; resilience without infection change should be limited.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)
    <ul>
      <li>Classics: Longevity gains need not show infection costs; tradeoffs are resource‑based.</li>
      <li>PC: Longevity gains often trade off with infection ecology; lifespan is selected to constrain epidemics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern control is upstream; rejuvenation shouldn’t inherently impose infection costs.</li>
      <li>PC: under pathogen challenge, pattern‑based gains still face infection penalties unless anti‑pathogen measures co‑apply.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: Chronic damage‑response activation is intrinsic and central.</li>
      <li>PC: Chronic activation is often maintained by infections; anti‑pathogen interventions should calm pathways/hazard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
