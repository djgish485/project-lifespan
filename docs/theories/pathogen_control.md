# Pathogen Control (Lidsky)

{{ popper_card() }}

> Seed: https://x.com/lidskypeter/status/1962526281863508444 (Web). Primary publications and a recent talk provide detail.

## Lay Summary

Aging may be the body’s way to keep chronic infections in check. By limiting how long individuals live, pathogens have less time to persist and spread. On this view, aging is not just wear and tear but an evolved “program” tuned by infectious disease pressure. At the cellular level, senescent cells may act like an “immune militia” during infection—useful short-term, harmful if not cleared.

## Technical Summary

- Pathogen Control Hypothesis: selection can favor finite lifespan setpoints to limit epidemic spread and pathogen persistence in host populations [@LidskyAndino2020; @LidskyAndino2022].
- Predictions emerge from epidemiological models: shorter lifespans reduce basic reproduction number or chronic carriage windows for certain pathogens; selection for lifespan depends on pathogen parameters and transmission ecology.
- Cellular senescence as “immune militia”: transient senescence provides antiviral benefits (resistance, paracrine signaling, orchestration with immune cells); chronic senescence is deleterious (requires immune clearance) — articulated in talks and lab aims (Web) and consistent with broader inflammaging literature [@Franceschi2018].
- Contrasts with nonprogrammed theories (disposable soma, antagonistic pleiotropy) by proposing direct adaptive benefit of aging via pathogen control.

## Evolutionary Context

Integrates life history theory with infectious disease dynamics: in environments with high transmission or chronic infections, finite lifespan can increase group-level and kin-level fitness by curbing epidemics; testable against comparative datasets [@LidskyYuanAndino2023].

## Core Claims

- {{ claim('lid-c1', 'Finite lifespan is an adaptation to limit infectious disease spread/persistence.', 'Species in high-pathogen environments evolve shorter lifespan setpoints, controlling for confounders.') }}
- {{ claim('lid-c2', 'Cellular senescence provides short-term antiviral benefits (immune militia) but is harmful if persistent.', 'Perturbing senescence/clearance alters viral control and post-infection outcomes.') }}

## Predictions (Operationalized)

- Comparative: Across species/populations, historical pathogen pressure correlates with lifespan after adjusting for body size, ecology, and extrinsic mortality.
- Experimental (mice): In a controlled chronic-infection model, selection or engineering toward shorter reproductive lifespan reduces pathogen prevalence; conversely, pathogen-free settings relax selection on lifespan.
- Senescence-virology: Senolytics or enhanced senescent cell clearance may impair resistance to certain viral infections; timed senescence induction/clearance improves outcomes.

## Evidence

- Modeling and theory: lifespan setpoints emerge in epidemiological models balancing pathogen dynamics and host fitness [@LidskyAndino2020; @LidskyAndino2022].
- Comparative framing and open questions outlined in [@LidskyYuanAndino2023] and long-form review [@LidskyEtAl2022].
- Related: inflammaging and chronic activation of damage/injury responses plausibly intersect with infection-driven aging [@Franceschi2018; @Ogrodnik2025].

## Rival Theories and Comparisons

- Nonprogrammed theories (disposable soma, antagonistic pleiotropy, mutation accumulation) explain aging without direct adaptive benefits; they predict different comparative patterns and intervention responses.
- Hyperfunction/mTOR and damage-repair (SENS) emphasize intrinsic drivers; pathogen-control posits extrinsic disease ecology as a primary selector.

## Critiques

### Outbound (Lidsky → others)

#### [Classic Models (Damage/AP/Disposable Soma)](classic_models.md)

- Classic Models say aging isn’t on purpose — it’s damage and selection tradeoffs. Under those assumptions, true rejuvenation (resetting to a younger state) shouldn’t be broadly available or strategically deployed; yet in nature, it is observed in some taxa and often under stress. PC explains this by epidemic risk: extended lifespan increases pathogen persistence/spread, so organisms avoid rejuvenation unless stress flips the fitness calculus.
- What occurs: Natural, stress‑induced rejuvenation in animals (e.g., jellyfish, comb jellies, some insects), referenced in Lidsky’s talk and posts.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li>Compare species that can “rejuvenate” under stress with the kinds of infections they face. If rejuvenators mostly live with high infection pressure and flip back only when stressed, it supports Pathogen Control; if not, it favors Classic Models. (1–3 months; $5k–$25k)</li>
      <li><a href="../experiments/rejuvenation_pathogen_tradeoff.md">Rejuvenation vs Pathogen Tradeoff</a> — Give older mice a rejuvenation treatment. Half also get an anti‑infection plan. If rejuvenation alone makes infections worse or doesn’t improve survival, but adding anti‑infection fixes that, it supports Pathogen Control. If rejuvenation alone helps with no infection downside, it favors Classic Models. (12–18 months; $400k–$800k)</li>
    </ul>

#### [SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)](sens_damage_repair.md)

- Big lifespan gains from repair could allow infections to persist/spread unless we also improve pathogen control.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_infection_tradeoff.md">Stacked Damage-Repair Under Chronic Infection</a> — Give older, infected mice multiple repair therapies. If repairs alone let infections linger or don’t boost survival, but adding anti‑infection restores benefits, it supports Pathogen Control. If repairs alone help with no infection downside, it supports SENS. (18–30 months; $700k–$1.5M)</li>
    </ul>
- Sources: [@LidskyAndino2020; @LidskyAndino2022].

#### [Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)](epigenetic_information.md)

- Broad rejuvenation might incur infection tradeoffs in pathogen‑rich contexts unless paired with pathogen control.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/osk_infection_tradeoff.md">OSK Partial Reprogramming Under Chronic Infection</a> — Give older mice OSK. Half also get an anti‑infection plan. If OSK alone shows infection penalties or weak survival gains, but OSK+anti‑infection does well, it supports Pathogen Control. If OSK alone helps without infection downsides, it supports the Sinclair view. (12–18 months; $450k–$900k)</li>
    </ul>


#### [Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)](resilience_criticality.md)

- If infections drive aging dynamics, reducing pathogen burden should improve resilience metrics (shorter autocorrelation time/variance) and reduce hazard.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/pathogen_burden_resilience.md">Reducing Pathogen Burden Improves Resilience Metrics</a> — Help older mice avoid or clear infections (vaccines/antivirals) and track day‑to‑day recovery and survival, compared to a standard longevity drug. Bigger gains from the anti‑infection plan support Pathogen Control; similar gains from the non‑infection drug support a resilience‑only view. (6–12 months; $150k–$300k)</li>
    </ul>
- Sources: [@Pyrkov2021] (metrics context).

#### [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

- Bioelectric‑driven rejuvenation/regeneration may face infection tradeoffs unless combined with anti‑pathogen measures.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/bioelectric_infection_tradeoff.md">Bioelectric Regeneration Under Pathogen Challenge</a> — Use electrical/ion‑channel methods to boost healing in older mice. If healing alone comes with infection downsides unless anti‑infection is added, it supports Pathogen Control; if not, it supports a bioelectric‑only view. (6–9 months; $120k–$250k)</li>
    </ul>


#### [Longevity Bottleneck](longevity_bottleneck.md)

- If chronic damage‑response activation is infection‑driven, reducing pathogen burden should normalize signaling and reduce hazard.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Anti‑Pathogen Interventions to Resolve Damage‑Response Bottlenecks</a> — Help older mice clear hidden infections. If inflammation/damage signals calm down and survival improves more than a standard longevity control, it supports Pathogen Control; if not, the bottleneck likely isn’t infection‑driven. (6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
    </ul>


### Inbound (from Sinclair (Epigenetic Information))

- Sinclair argues partial reprogramming (OSK) can extend healthspan/lifespan without infection downsides. If OSK works under pathogen challenge without anti‑infection support, that weakens Pathogen Control.
