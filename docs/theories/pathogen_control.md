# Pathogen Control (Lidsky)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging evolves to curb pathogen spread/persistence; finite lifespan limits epidemics. Senescent cells act as an antiviral “militia” when timed/cleared correctly.
- Infection tradeoffs: In high‑burden settings, big longevity gains should come with infection penalties unless anti‑pathogen measures co‑apply.
- Comparative/experimental signature: longevity wins without infection costs under challenge weigh against this view.

#### [SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)](sens_damage_repair.md)

      <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_infection_tradeoff.md">Stacked Damage-Repair Under Chronic Infection</a> — Give older, infected mice multiple repair therapies. If repairs alone let infections linger or don’t boost survival, but adding anti‑infection restores benefits, it supports Pathogen Control. If repairs alone help with no infection downside, it supports SENS. (18–30 months; $700k–$1.5M)</li>
    </ul>

#### [Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)](epigenetic_information.md)

- Broad rejuvenation might incur infection tradeoffs in pathogen‑rich contexts unless paired with pathogen control.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/osk_infection_tradeoff.md">OSK Partial Reprogramming Under Chronic Infection</a> — Give older mice OSK. Half also get an anti‑infection plan. If OSK alone shows infection penalties or weak survival gains, but OSK+anti‑infection does well, it supports Pathogen Control. If OSK alone helps without infection downsides, it supports the Sinclair view. (12–18 months; $450k–$900k)</li>
    </ul>


#### [Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)](resilience_criticality.md)

- If infections drive aging dynamics, reducing pathogen burden should improve resilience metrics (shorter autocorrelation time/variance) and reduce hazard.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/pathogen_burden_resilience.md">Reducing Pathogen Burden Improves Resilience Metrics</a> — Help older mice avoid or clear infections (vaccines/antivirals) and track day‑to‑day recovery and survival, compared to a standard longevity drug. Bigger gains from the anti‑infection plan support Pathogen Control; similar gains from the non‑infection drug support a resilience‑only view. (6–12 months; $150k–$300k)</li>
    </ul>
- Sources: [@Pyrkov2021] (metrics context).

#### [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

- Bioelectric‑driven rejuvenation/regeneration may face infection tradeoffs unless combined with anti‑pathogen measures.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/bioelectric_infection_tradeoff.md">Bioelectric Regeneration Under Pathogen Challenge</a> — Use electrical/ion‑channel methods to boost healing in older mice. If healing alone comes with infection downsides unless anti‑infection is added, it supports Pathogen Control; if not, it supports a bioelectric‑only view. (6–9 months; $120k–$250k)</li>
    </ul>


#### [Longevity Bottleneck](longevity_bottleneck.md)

- If chronic damage‑response activation is infection‑driven, reducing pathogen burden should normalize signaling and reduce hazard.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="../experiments/anti_pathogen_bottleneck.md">Anti‑Pathogen Interventions to Resolve Damage‑Response Bottlenecks</a> — Help older mice clear hidden infections.

(6–9 months; $100k–$220k)</li>
    </ul>
