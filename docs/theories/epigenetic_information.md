# Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging is driven largely by loss/mis‑specification of epigenetic information; partial reprogramming (e.g., OSK) can reset gene‑expression programs and restore youthful function.
- Not just biomarkers: lifespan extension at whole‑animal level must be shown while managing tumor risk; tissue wins are strongest so far (e.g., retina/optic nerve).
- Practical signature: state reset improves function and hazard with acceptable safety; strong gains without enumerating/repairing all damages would favor this view.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)
    <ul>
      <li>SENS: Multiple damages jointly cause aging; targeted repairs are necessary.</li>
      <li>Sinclair: A correct state reset can obviate many repairs; large, safe OSK wins would weigh against damage‑first primacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)
    <ul>
      <li>Classics: Gains should show tradeoffs/costs; no “program” to reset.</li>
      <li>Sinclair: Durable max‑lifespan gains from reprogramming with limited costs would challenge strict tradeoff/budget constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pathogen Control (Lidsky)
    <ul>
      <li>PC: Under pathogen challenge, rejuvenation should face infection penalties unless anti‑pathogen measures co‑apply.</li>
      <li>Sinclair: OSK can succeed without infection penalties under pathogen challenge; clean wins favor epigenetic primacy over PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)
    <ul>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard reductions can occur by tuning dynamics without a state reset.</li>
      <li>Sinclair: A state reset should reduce hazard more broadly than non‑epigenetic resilience interventions if epigenetic mis‑specification is primary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern goals sit “above” gene expression; spatial cues write targets.</li>
      <li>Sinclair: Reprogramming can indirectly restore pattern control via gene networks; OSK may substitute for pattern cues in some tissues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: Specific damage‑response pathways drive aging.</li>
      <li>Sinclair: A global epigenetic reset can normalize many pathways without bespoke fixes; strong wins support epigenetic primacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
