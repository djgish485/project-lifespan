## Lay Summary

The idea: cells lose “epigenetic instructions” over time, scrambling which genes turn on or off. If you reset these instructions, cells can act young again. Experiments with partial reprogramming (e.g., OSK factors) appear to rejuvenate certain tissues in mice.

## Technical Summary

- Hypothesis: age-associated phenotypes are largely driven by epigenetic drift/misalignment rather than irreversible damage; resetting epigenetic state realigns gene expression and function [@Yang2023].
- Mechanisms: DNA/histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, transcription factor networks; partial reprogramming (OSK) aims to revert epigenome without dedifferentiation [@Ocampo2016; @Lu2020].
- Distinguish biomarkers (epigenetic clocks) from causal mechanisms; epigenetic age reversal may not imply lifespan extension.

## Evolutionary Context

Speculates that organisms trade off plasticity and stability; noise in epigenetic maintenance accumulates with age. Requires a mechanistic rationale for why selection leaves large reversible epigenetic liabilities.

## Core Claims

- {{ claim('c1', 'Loss of epigenetic information is a principal cause of aging phenotypes.', 'Restoring epigenetic state restores function independent of other repair.') }}
- {{ claim('c2', 'Partial reprogramming can rejuvenate tissues without oncogenic transformation.', 'OSK in adult mice improves function and extends healthspan with acceptable tumor risk.') }}

## Predictions (Operationalized)

- Partial reprogramming in adult mice reduces all-cause hazard vs control and increases maximum lifespan by ≥10% without increasing tumor incidence.
- Tissue-specific reprogramming restores function (e.g., optic nerve regeneration) in aged mice with pre-registered endpoints.

## Evidence

### For

- Tissue rejuvenation and functional improvements following OSK in retina/optic nerve injury and glaucoma models [@Lu2020].
- Induced epigenetic perturbations accelerate aging-like phenotypes; partial reset restores function in selected contexts [@Yang2023].
- Partial reprogramming ameliorates age-associated hallmarks and improves survival in progeroid mice [@Ocampo2016].

### Against / Disconfirmations

- Tumorigenesis risk with reprogramming; mixed or absent whole-organism lifespan results to date; potential confounding by stress responses and off-target effects.
- Epigenetic clocks may reverse without corresponding lifespan gains; need pre-registered, blinded lifespan studies.

## Rival Theories and Comparisons

- Damage-first (SENS), hyperfunction/mTOR, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence; assess which uniquely predicts lifespan changes beyond biomarker shifts.

## Critiques

### Outbound (Sinclair → others)

#### [SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)](sens_damage_repair.md)

- If loss of epigenetic information is primary, resetting state should extend maximum lifespan without needing to enumerate and repair all damage classes. Large, clean OSK wins with low toxicity would reduce the need for a broad repair stack.
- SENS expects that adding specific repairs should still be required for major lifespan gains; if OSK alone matches or exceeds stacked repairs, that challenges a damage‑first primacy.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — Give aged mice cyclic OSK and track lifespan and tumors. If OSK alone robustly increases max lifespan with acceptable safety, that favors Sinclair. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/sens_stack_mouse.md">SENS Stacked Repairs</a> — Repair multiple damage classes in aged mice and compare hazard/max lifespan vs OSK results under similar controls. If stacked repairs are needed for large gains, that favors SENS. (24–36 months; $1.2M–$2.5M)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Classic Models (Damage/AP/Disposable Soma)](classic_models.md)

- Broad rejuvenation from partial reprogramming suggests constraint is not only cumulative damage or repair budget limits. A durable max‑lifespan increase from OSK would directly contradict “no program” expectations.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — If OSK extends maximum lifespan substantially without obvious tradeoff costs, that challenges Classic Models’ budget/pleiotropy framing. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](pathogen_control.md)

- Under pathogen challenge, Sinclair predicts OSK can improve healthspan/lifespan without needing anti‑infection measures; PC predicts infection penalties unless pathogen control co‑applies.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_infection_tradeoff.md">OSK Under Chronic Infection</a> — Run OSK in aged, infected mice with/without anti‑pathogen support. If OSK alone succeeds without infection downsides, that favors Sinclair; if combo is needed, that favors PC. (12–18 months; $450k–$900k)</li>
  </ul>

#### [Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)](resilience_criticality.md)

- If epigenetic mis‑specification is primary, resetting state should reduce hazard even if resilience metrics are not explicitly targeted; resilience‑only training should not match OSK’s effects if Sinclair is primary.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — Test whether a state reset lowers all‑cause hazard more than non‑infection resilience interventions. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/resilience_training.md">Resilience Training</a> — Benchmark hazard and resilience‑metric gains for non‑epigenetic interventions and compare to OSK results. (12–24 months; $150k–$300k)</li>
  </ul>
- Sources: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23014-1">Resilience metrics (Pyrkov2021)</a>; Sinclair primary above

#### [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

- If epigenetic reprogramming restores correct gene‑expression programs, it may re‑establish morphogenetic control indirectly; conversely, if bioelectric pattern control is primary, OSK may be unnecessary.

- Discriminator experiment(s):
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../experiments/osk_mouse_lifespan.md">OSK Lifespan Study</a> — Systemic state reset outcomes in aged mice. (18–30 months; $600k–$1.2M)</li>
    <li><a href="../experiments/vmem_regeneration.md">Bioelectric Modulation</a> — Tissue‑level pattern control in aged mice; compare functional rejuvenation to OSK outcomes. (3–6 months; $100k–$200k)</li>
