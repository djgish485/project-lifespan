# Other Theories

Short, plain‑English summaries of additional aging frameworks beyond the seven core pages. Each item notes what the theory claims, recent progress, and what would most decisively test it.

## Hyperfunction / Quasi‑Program (mTOR)
- What it says: Aging partly comes from growth programs running too long (mTOR “run‑on”); dialing them down can slow decline.
- What works (in animals): Late‑life rapamycin extends mouse lifespan and healthspan, including starts at ~20 months<sup><a class="ref-pop" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08221" data-ref-url="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08221" data-ref-summary="Harrison et al. 2009: dietary rapamycin begun late extends lifespan in genetically heterogeneous mice.">†</a></sup>. Low‑dose TORC1 inhibition improved flu vaccine responses in older adults<sup><a class="ref-pop" href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3009892" data-ref-url="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3009892" data-ref-summary="Mannick et al. 2014: mTORC1‑preferential inhibition enhances elderly immune/vaccine responses.">†</a></sup>.
- Criticisms/caveats: Effects depend on dose/schedule/sex/strain; high/continuous dosing can impair glucose handling (intermittent or combo regimens help)<sup><a class="ref-pop" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3727050" data-ref-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3727050" data-ref-summary="Lamming et al. 2013: dietary rapamycin causes glucose intolerance in HET3 mice with nuances vs injection.">†</a></sup><sup><a class="ref-pop" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892694" data-ref-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892694" data-ref-summary="Weiss et al. 2018: metformin blunts rapamycin‑induced glucose intolerance in female mice.">†</a></sup>. Benefits may be driven partly by anticancer effects (median > max lifespan gains). Human lifespan data are absent; a dog lifespan/healthspan trial is ongoing<sup><a class="ref-pop" href="https://dogagingproject.org/triad" data-ref-url="https://dogagingproject.org/triad" data-ref-summary="Dog Aging Project TRIAD: randomized trial of rapamycin in companion dogs.">†</a></sup>.
- How it stacks with other theories: Best used with complementary levers—
  - SENS‑style repair (fixes existing lesions) while mTOR dialing reduces “run‑on” damage.
  - Senescent‑cell clearance to cut SASP/inflammation, then maintain with rapamycin.
  - Proteostasis/autophagy boosters (lysosome/TFEB or chaperones) for housekeeping beyond mTOR.
  - Systemic milieu/microbiome resets to improve the top‑down environment.
- What would convince skeptics: In normal aged animals, intermittent TORC1‑preferential regimens that (a) lower mortality and improve multi‑organ function, (b) show hazard‑shape changes beyond anticancer delay, and (c) translate in dogs—with acceptable safety.

## Somatic Mutation / Mosaicism
- What it says: DNA “letter” changes build up in tissues, forming mutant clones that impair function and raise disease risk; this burden scales with lifespan and cell turnover.
- Recent progress: Single‑cell and bulk sequencing show age‑related mutation/clonal expansion in many tissues (e.g., blood CHIP). Cross‑species work links mutation rates with lifespan.
- Key tests: Reducing mutation load or culling harmful clones (editing, replacement) should lower hazard and restore function in ways not explained by other mechanisms.

## Senescent Cells (SASP)
- What it says: Senescent cells accumulate and secrete inflammatory factors (SASP) that disrupt tissues. Clearing them improves healthspan.
- Recent progress: Genetic ablation and senolytics improve multiple functions in mice; early human trials show signals in specific indications, though results are mixed by drug/dose and disease.
- Key tests: In normal aged animals, do senolytics lower mortality and improve multi‑organ function with acceptable safety, and how do effects compare to epigenetic resets or mTOR inhibition?

## Proteostasis Collapse (Chaperones, Autophagy, Lysosomes)
- What it says: With age, cells lose the ability to fold, clear, and recycle proteins; misfolded/aggregated proteins drive dysfunction.
- Recent progress: Broad evidence across species; interventions that boost chaperones or autophagy (e.g., heat‑shock pathways, lysosomal function) improve stress resistance and some age phenotypes.
- Key tests: Durable, multi‑tissue restoration of proteostasis should reduce functional decline and hazard independent of other pathways.

## Systemic Milieu / Parabiosis
- What it says: Blood‑borne factors powerfully push tissues toward younger or older states. Changing the circulating environment rejuvenates function.
- Recent progress: Heterochronic parabiosis, plasma fractionation, and “neutral blood exchange” improve multiple tissue readouts in mice. Human plasma exchange/FMT studies hint systemic leverage but need larger trials.
- Key tests: In normal aged animals (and eventually humans), does modifying the milieu alone drive broad, durable gains in function/hazard vs. local tissue interventions?

## Microbiome / Inflammaging
- What it says: Age‑shifted gut ecosystems amplify chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction; restoring a youthful microbiome improves resilience.
- Recent progress: Microbiome transplants extend lifespan in short‑lived fish and improve metabolic markers in mammals; human FMT is established for infection and under study for aging‑relevant endpoints.
- Key tests: Controlled microbiome resets that deliver durable, systemic function gains and hazard reduction beyond diet/weight effects.

## Transposable Elements (TE) Derepression
- What it says: Loss of TE silencing (e.g., LINE‑1) with age triggers innate immunity, DNA damage, and senescence; blocking TE activity reduces these signals.
- Recent progress: TE activity rises in aged/senescent cells; reverse‑transcriptase inhibitors reduce inflammation and senescence markers in models.
- Key tests: TE suppression lowers hazard and restores function broadly in normal aged animals, beyond effects explained by senescence or proteostasis alone.
- Sources: Nature 2019 (10.1038/s41586-018-0784-9) on L1‑IFN in senescence; follow‑up RT‑inhibitor studies.

## Membrane Pacemaker (Lipid Peroxidation)
- What it says: Species with more peroxidation‑resistant membrane lipids tend to live longer; membrane composition sets metabolic pace and oxidative damage risk.
- Recent progress: Strong comparative biology; interventional membrane remodeling is emerging (diet/genetic), but definitive lifespan tests are limited.
- Key tests: Directly shifting membrane composition in mammals should change hazard/function independent of other pathways.
- Sources: Hulbert AJ, Integr Comp Biol 2005 (10.1093/icb/45.5.475).

## Hypothalamic / Neuroendocrine Control
- What it says: The hypothalamus orchestrates systemic aging via inflammation, microglia, and hormones (e.g., GnRH). Tweaks here ripple body‑wide.
- Recent progress: Rodent studies link hypothalamic inflammation and stem‑cell dynamics to aging; hormonal interventions show partial rescue.
- Key tests: Selective, safe modulation of hypothalamic pathways that broadly lowers hazard and restores multi‑organ function.
- Sources: Zhang et al., Nature 2013 (10.1038/nature12143) and follow‑ups.

## Telomere Attrition
- What it says: Telomere shortening and damage drive replicative limits and senescence; telomerase or telomere protection can restore capacity in some contexts.
- Recent progress: Telomerase gene therapy extends lifespan in mice without increasing cancer in specific settings; human work focuses on safety and disease targets.
- Key tests: Safe, targeted telomere restoration that improves function and lowers hazard in normal aged mammals.
