# Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging is not “on purpose” — it reflects damage accumulation and selection tradeoffs (antagonistic pleiotropy) with finite investment in repair (disposable soma).
- Predictions: increasing repair generally trades off with reproduction/fitness; rejuvenation is constrained by maintenance budgets; no adaptive lifespan setpoint is required.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)
    <ul>
      <li>Sinclair: State reset can yield large gains with limited costs.</li>
      <li>Classics: Expect visible tradeoffs (e.g., tumor risk, impaired function) or modest gains; big low‑cost wins challenge this view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)
    <ul>
      <li>SENS: Combined repairs can extend max lifespan significantly.</li>
      <li>Classics: Diminishing returns/toxicity should limit gains; large, safe extensions push beyond budget constraints.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pathogen Control (Lidsky)
    <ul>
      <li>PC: Longevity gains often trade off with infection ecology.</li>
      <li>Classics: No intrinsic infection penalty required; tradeoffs are resource‑based. If rejuvenation under pathogen challenge shows no infection downside, that favors Classics; if penalties appear without anti‑pathogen measures, it favors PC.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)
    <ul>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard can shift by tuning system dynamics.</li>
      <li>Classics: Large, low‑cost hazard shifts are surprising without underlying resource tradeoffs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern cues can rejuvenate without large repair budgets.</li>
      <li>Classics: Strong, low‑cost gains via pattern cues would strain damage/repair budget framing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: A small number of pathways dominate aging.</li>
      <li>Classics: Diffuse damage/tradeoffs across systems; single chokepoints are unlikely to explain most aging.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
