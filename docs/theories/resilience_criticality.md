# Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)

## Simple Summary

- Idea: Aging is a system‑level loss of resilience (critical slowing) — recovery from perturbations becomes slower and variance rises; tuning dynamics can lower hazard.
- Not just parts: focus is on the whole‑system controller; measure/restore resilience rather than enumerating specific damages.

## Conflicts With Other Theories

<ul>
  <li>Classic Models (Medawar, Williams, Hamilton, Kirkwood)
    <ul>
      <li>Classics: Tradeoffs/damage explain hazard; resilience focus is secondary.</li>
      <li>Resilience: System dynamics predict hazard and intervention response beyond tradeoff framing; big hazard shifts without obvious costs challenge Classics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pathogen Control (Lidsky)
    <ul>
      <li>PC: Reducing pathogen burden is the main lever for hazard improvements.</li>
      <li>Resilience: Hazard can be lowered by improving recovery dynamics without infection changes; similar/better gains vs anti‑pathogen plans favor this view.</li>
      <li>PC further predicts lifespan differences that track population structure (dispersal, eusociality, cohorting), which resilience alone does not specify.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Epigenetic Information (Sinclair) and SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)
    <ul>
      <li>Sinclair/SENS: Reset/repair is primary; dynamics follow.</li>
      <li>Resilience: Tuning dynamics shifts hazard broadly; state resets/repairs may not be required for large gains.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)
    <ul>
      <li>Levin: Pattern goals drive repair; spatial cues write targets.</li>
      <li>Resilience: Global dynamics dominate outcomes; pattern control is one lever among many.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longevity Bottleneck (Various Proponents)
    <ul>
      <li>Bottleneck: One/few pathways dominate aging.</li>
      <li>Resilience: Many pathways funnel through common dynamics; pathway‑specific fixes may underperform dynamic tuning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
