# Restoring Physiological Resilience to Reduce Mortality Hazard

Linked theory: [Resilience / Criticality (Peter Fedichev)](../theories/resilience_criticality.md)

## Hypothesis

Loss of resilience (increased autocorrelation time/variance of organismal state) is causal for rising mortality hazard; interventions that reduce autocorrelation times improve survival.

## Prediction (Measurable)

- Time-series resilience metrics (DOSI autocorrelation time) decrease ≥20% vs. control after intervention; sustained over ≥3 months.
- Mortality hazard reduced (HR ≤0.85) vs. control.

## Essentials Protocol

- Model: Aged C57BL/6J (20 months), mixed sex.
- N: 50/arm.
- Intervention: Structured resilience training (alternating thermal, hypoxia/hypoxia-mimetic, controlled exercise), or pharmacological modulators targeting stress-response dynamics. Positive control: rapamycin.
- Data: Longitudinal CBC, activity monitoring (wearables), frailty indices.

## Controls

- Sham training; young baseline cohort for reference only; rapamycin.

## Endpoints and Analysis

- Primary: Mortality hazard; Secondary: DOSI metrics, frailty, recovery time from standardized perturbations.
- Analysis: Autocorrelation/variance estimation; Cox models; pre-registration.

## Cost/Time/Ethics

- Cost: $150k–$300k; Timeline: 12–24 months.
- Ethical: Monitor animal stress; humane endpoints.

## Falsifiers

- No improvement in resilience metrics or hazard reduction.
