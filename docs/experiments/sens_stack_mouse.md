# Stacked Damage-Repair Interventions in Aged Mice (SENS-Inspired)

Linked theory: [SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)](../theories/sens_damage_repair.md)

## Hypothesis

Multiple damage classes jointly drive age-related decline; periodic repair targeting multiple classes in combination extends maximum lifespan beyond any single agent.

## Prediction (Measurable)

- Max lifespan: ≥15% increase vs. best single-agent arm.
- Hazard: Combined arm hazard ratio ≤0.80 vs. vehicle.

## Essentials Protocol

- Model: C57BL/6J, mixed sex, aged 20 months at randomization.
- N: 70/arm (accounts for multiple-arm comparison and interaction effects).
- Arms (illustrative): Vehicle; D+Q senolytics (intermittent) [@Xu2018]; crosslink breaker candidate; anti-amyloid/aggregate clearance; combined (2–3 most synergistic per pilot). Positive control: rapamycin.
- Randomization/blinding: As per pre-registration; standardized husbandry.

## Controls

- Single-agent arms; vehicle; rapamycin benchmark.

## Endpoints and Analysis

- Primary: Max lifespan; Secondary: hazard, frailty index, pathology panel (senescent burden, crosslinking, aggregates), functional assays.
- Analysis: Survival models with interaction terms; correction for multiple comparisons; pre-specified stopping rules for toxicity.

## Cost/Time/Ethics

- Cost: $1.2M–$2.5M; Timeline: 24–36 months.
- Ethical: Monitor toxicity; humane endpoints.

## Falsifiers

- No max lifespan gain beyond best single agent; or adverse interaction profiles.
