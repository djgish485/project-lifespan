# Anti-Pathogen Interventions to Resolve Damage-Response Bottlenecks

Linked theories: [Pathogen Control (Peter Lidsky)](../theories/pathogen_control.md), [Longevity Bottleneck](../theories/longevity_bottleneck.md)

## Hypothesis

If chronic activation of damage-response pathways is infection-driven, anti-pathogen measures should normalize signaling and reduce hazard.

## Design

- Model: Aged mice (18–20 months) with elevated inflammatory tone.
- Arms (N=30/arm): Vehicle; Anti-pathogen protocol (vaccination/antiviral/antimicrobial per vet guidance); Non-infection control (e.g., rapamycin).
- Biomarkers: Cytokine panel, damage-response pathway markers (e.g., NF-κB activation), frailty.

## Endpoints

- Primary: Normalization of signaling markers; Secondary: hazard over 6–9 months, frailty improvements.

## Time & Cost (est.)

- 6–9 months; $100k–$220k.

## Discriminator

- PC-consistent: Anti-pathogen arm normalizes pathways and reduces hazard beyond non-infection control.
- Bottleneck without infection driver: No added benefit from anti-pathogen vs non-infection control.
