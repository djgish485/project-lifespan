# Bioelectric Regeneration Under Pathogen Challenge

Linked theories: [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](../theories/pathogen_control.md), [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](../theories/bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

## Hypothesis

Bioelectric modulation that improves regeneration/healthspan shows infection tradeoffs under pathogen challenge unless anti-pathogen measures co-apply.

## Design

- Model: Aged mice (18–22 months), digit-tip or skin wound model.
- Pathogen: Controlled colonization/infection compatible with ABSL-2.
- Arms (N=25/arm): Sham; Bioelectric modulation; Anti-pathogen; Bioelectric+Anti-pathogen.

## Endpoints

- Regeneration metrics (length/area), infection burden, hazard (tracking to 6–9 months), histology.

## Time & Cost (est.)

- 6–9 months; $120k–$250k.

## Discriminator

- PC: Bioelectric alone shows infection tradeoffs vs combined arm; combined mitigates with maintained regeneration.
- Bioelectric-only frameworks: No infection tradeoffs under challenge.
