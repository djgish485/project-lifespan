# OSK Partial Reprogramming Under Chronic Infection

Linked theories: [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](../theories/pathogen_control.md), [Epigenetic Information (Sinclair)](../theories/epigenetic_information.md)

## Hypothesis

Partial reprogramming improves healthspan; under chronic infection, it incurs infection tradeoffs unless pathogen control co-improves.

## Design

- Model: Aged C57BL/6J (20 months).
- Infection: Chronic low-virulence pathogen model (ABSL-2).
- Arms (N=40/arm): Vehicle; OSK regimen; Antiviral/Vaccine; OSK+Antiviral.
- Dosing: OSK weekly cycles (1w on/2w off) per tolerability pilot; doxycycline-controlled.

## Endpoints

- Hazard, maximum lifespan, infection burden, tumor incidence, epigenetic age.

## Time & Cost (est.)

- 12–18 months; $450k–$900k.

## Discriminator

- PC: OSK alone shows infection penalty or limited hazard gain vs combined arm.
- Sinclair: OSK extends lifespan without infection penalty under challenge.
