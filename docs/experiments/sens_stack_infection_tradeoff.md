# Stacked Damage-Repair Under Chronic Infection

Linked theories: [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](../theories/pathogen_control.md), [SENS Damage Repair (de Grey)](../theories/sens_damage_repair.md)

## Hypothesis

Stacked repairs that extend lifespan increase infection persistence/transmission proxies unless anti-pathogen interventions co-apply.

## Design

- Model: Aged C57BL/6J, chronic low-virulence infection.
- Arms (N=50/arm): Vehicle; Best single repair; Stacked repairs; Anti-pathogen; Stacked+Anti-pathogen.
- Repairs: e.g., senolytics (D+Q), crosslink breaker candidate, aggregate clearance; calibrate doses via pilot.

## Endpoints

- Hazard, maximum lifespan, infection burden/transmission proxies, frailty, pathology panel.

## Time & Cost (est.)

- 18–30 months; $700k–$1.5M.

## Discriminator

- PC: Stacked repairs alone show infection penalties or limited hazard benefit vs combined arm.
- SENS: Stacked repairs extend lifespan without infection penalties under challenge.
