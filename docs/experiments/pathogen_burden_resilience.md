# Reducing Pathogen Burden Improves Resilience Metrics

Linked theories: [Pathogen Control (Lidsky)](../theories/pathogen_control.md), [Resilience / Criticality (Fedichev)](../theories/resilience_criticality.md)

## Hypothesis

Anti-pathogen interventions reduce autocorrelation time/variance of organismal state and lower hazard beyond non-infection interventions.

## Design

- Model: Aged mice (18–20 months), cohorts with natural microbiome/pathogen burden.
- Arms (N=30/arm): Vehicle; Broad-spectrum prophylaxis (e.g., vaccination panel/antivirals/antimicrobials per vet guidance); Non-infection longevity control (e.g., rapamycin).
- Longitudinal data: CBC (for DOSI), activity telemetry, frailty index.

## Endpoints

- Primary: DOSI autocorrelation time; Secondary: variance, hazard, frailty.

## Time & Cost (est.)

- 6–12 months; $150k–$300k.

## Discriminator

- PC: Anti-pathogen arm reduces DOSI autocorrelation and hazard beyond non-infection control.
- Resilience-only: Similar improvements without pathogen-specific interventions.
