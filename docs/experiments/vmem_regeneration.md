# Bioelectric Modulation to Rejuvenate Regeneration in Aged Mice

Linked theory: [Bioelectric / Morphogenetic Control (Levin)](../theories/bioelectric_morphogenetic_control.md)

## Hypothesis

Bioelectric state modulates morphogenetic control; restoring youthful Vmem patterns in aged tissues improves regeneration capacity.

## Prediction (Measurable)

- Improved digit tip or skin wound regeneration metrics in aged mice vs. sham.
- No increase in tumorigenesis or aberrant growth.

## Essentials Protocol

- Model: Aged C57BL/6J (18–22 months), digit tip amputation or full-thickness skin wound model.
- N: 20–30/arm.
- Intervention: Ion channel modulators (e.g., V-ATPase, Kir2.1), optogenetic or electrical stimulation protocols tailored to target tissue Vmem states.
- Arms (illustrative): Sham; Uniform stimulation; Pattern-aware differential stimulation (target both affected cells and immediate neighbors per tissue map); Pharmacologic controls.
- Blinding and randomization enforced; pre-registered endpoints.

## Controls

- Sham stimulation; vehicle; young cohort reference; pharmacologic controls.

## Endpoints and Analysis

- Primary: Regrowth length/area; Secondary: histology, function, scarring, off-target growth.
- Analysis: Pre-specified metrics; blinded scoring. Include information-dynamics metrics where feasible (active information storage, transfer entropy; spatial entropy) to test predicted signatures.

## Cost/Time/Ethics

- Cost: $120k–$250k; Timeline: 3–6 months.
- Ethical: Minimize discomfort, analgesia, humane endpoints.

## Falsifiers

- No measurable regeneration improvement; or increased aberrant growth.
