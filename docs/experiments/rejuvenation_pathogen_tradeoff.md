# Rejuvenation vs Pathogen Tradeoff in Aged Mice

Linked theories: [Pathogen Control (Peter Lidsky)](../theories/pathogen_control.md), [Classic Models](../theories/classic_models.md), [Epigenetic Information (David Sinclair)](../theories/epigenetic_information.md)

## Hypothesis

Under chronic pathogen challenge, interventions that induce rejuvenation/extend lifespan incur infection tradeoffs unless pathogen control is co-improved.

## Design

- Model: Aged C57BL/6J mice (20–22 months), mixed sex.
- Pathogen: Low-virulence chronic infection (e.g., MHV or Influenza persistence model) under ABSL-2; pre-study validation for stable burden.
- Arms (N=40/arm; power ~80% for HR 0.8, alpha 0.05):
  1) Vehicle control
  2) Rejuvenation (e.g., OSK partial reprogramming regimen)
  3) Anti-pathogen (e.g., prophylactic vaccination/antiviral) 
  4) Combo: Rejuvenation + Anti-pathogen
- Randomization/blinding: Cage-blocked randomization; blinded survival/pathology; pre-registered endpoints.

## Endpoints

- Primary: All-cause hazard (Cox), maximum lifespan (top decile), infection burden (PCR titers, histopathology).
- Secondary: Frailty index, epigenetic age (blood/liver), tumor incidence, cytokine panel.

## Analysis

- Survival curves + Cox PH with arm covariates; infection metrics compared via mixed models; interaction term tests (rejuvenation×anti-pathogen).

## Time & Cost (est.)

- Time: 12–18 months (infection setup 2–3 mo; survival 9–12+ mo).
- Cost: $400k–$800k (infection facility, OSK vectors, sequencing, husbandry).

## Discriminator

- Supports PC if Arm 2 raises infection metrics or fails to lower hazard unless combined (Arm 4) improves both infection control and hazard.
- Supports Classic Models if rejuvenation extends lifespan without infection penalties under chronic challenge.
